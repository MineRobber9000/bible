\section{Miscellaneous Hebrew tidbits}\label{app:misc-heb}
\subsection{\textit{waw} voweling}\label{app:waw-voweling}
\Hebrew{וָ} means that things are supposed to be considered together (like a list).

\subsection{Paronomasia}\label{app:paronomasia}
Hebrew loves paronomasia (e.g., observed an observing, dreamed a dream), but it doesn't work idiomatically in English so it is generally avoided in this translation.

\subsection{Peculiar}\label{app:peculiar}
\textsc{halot} defines \Hebrew{סְגֻלָּה} as ``\textbf{personal property}: --- 1.\ secular, of David\dots\ of kings, etc.\dots\ --- 2.\ theological, Israel is Yahweh's.'' The \textsc{kjv} renders it as ``peculiar'' in both Exodus and 1~Peter. However, peculiar doesn't mean the same thing in modern English as in Jacobean English where it means ``treasured.''

\subsection{Poetic view of water in antiquity}\label{app:water-in-antiquity}
The belief was that there is water above and below the earth. When water comes from above, it's seen as a good thing. However, when water comes from below, it is bad and generally brings about death and destruction.
