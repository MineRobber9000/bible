\subsection{\Hebrew{הִנֵּֽנִי}}
In Genesis 22:1, Abraham says ``\Hebrew{הִנֵּֽנִי}'' which means anything from ``Behold!'' to ``I am here'' to ``Pay attention.'' It's a pretty all inclusive word with ``Yes?'' being an appropriate, idiomatic response.

\subsection{Amen}
\textsc{halot} for \Hebrew{אָמֵן}: \textbf{surely!}, solemn formula by wh\@. the hearer a) accepts the validity of a curse or oath, b) accepts a salutary message, or c) joins himself to a doxology.

\subsection{``Called him''}
When it says ``called him'' it's always (in the Hebrew) ``called his name,'' but this rendering just plain doesn't work in idiomatic English.
