    \verse{19:1} Two messengers\ca{prp \Hebrew{xxxx} cf 12.\thinspace16}{probably ``men,'' compare verses~12 and~16.} came to Sodom in the evening as\lit{and} Lot was sitting at Sodom's gate. And Lot saw them and stood to greet them, and bowed down, his face to the ground.%%
    \verse{19:2} He said, ``My lords, please, please turn in to your servant's house: spend the night, wash your feet, get up early, and go on your way.'' But they said, ``No. We will spend the night in the open.''%%
    \verse{19:3} He urged them strongly, and they turned aside to him and came into his house. He prepared\lit{made} a feast for them, baked unleavened bread,\halot{for ordinary meals} and they ate.%%
    \verse{19:4} Before they lay down, the men\ed{Remember that ``men'' is the Hebrew mass noun for both men and women. It can technically just mean men, but I find it highly unlikely that such a sexually driven culture (cf.~v5) would only consist of homosexuals.} of the city~--- the men of Sodom\ca{frt gl}{perhaps glossed}~--- from young to old~--- to the last man\lit{all the people from the edge}\halot{to the last man}~--- surrounded the house,%%
    \verse{19:5} and they called out to Lot and said to him, ``Where are the men that have come in to you tonight? Bring them out to us so we can have sex with them.''\ed{This is super messed up. Absolutely disgusting behavior.}%%
