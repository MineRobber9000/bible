    \verse{19:1} Two messengers\ca{prp \Hebrew{הָאֲנָשִׁים} cf 12.\thinspace16}{probably ``men,'' compare verses~12 and~16.} came to Sodom in the evening as\lit{and} Lot was sitting at Sodom's gate. And Lot saw them and stood to greet them, and bowed down, his face to the ground.%%
    \verse{19:2} He said, ``My lords, please, please turn in to your servant's house: spend the night, wash your feet, get up early, and go on your way.'' But they said, ``No. We will spend the night in the open.''%%
    \verse{19:3} He urged them strongly, and they turned aside to him and came into his house. He prepared\lit{made} a feast for them, baked unleavened bread,\halot{for ordinary meals} and they ate.%%
    \verse{19:4} Before they lay down, the men\ed{Remember that ``men'' is the Hebrew mass noun for both men and women. It can technically just mean men, but I find it highly unlikely that such a sexually driven culture (cf.~v5) would only consist of homosexuals.} of the city (the men of Sodom)\ca{frt gl}{perhaps glossed} from young to old~--- to the last man\lit{all the people from the edge}\halot{to the last man}~--- surrounded the house,%%
    \verse{19:5} and they called out to Lot and said to him, ``Where are the men that have come in to you tonight? Bring them out to us so we can have sex with them.''\ed{This is super messed up. Absolutely disgusting behavior.}%%
    \verse{19:6} Lot went out to them~--- to the entrance~--- closed the door behind himself%%
    \verse{19:7} and said, ``My brethren, please don't behave objectionably.\alt{do evilly}\ed{Bold talk coming from him.}%%
    \verse{19:8} I have two virgin\lit{who have not had sex with a man} daughters. Please let me bring them out to you and you can do whatever you want to them;\lit{do with them what is good in your eyes} just\alt{only} don't do anything to these men because\lit{for therefore} they've come under the shadow of my house.''\ed{Unarguably more messed up.}%%
    \verse{19:9} They said, ``Stand back!''\alt{Get away!} And they said,\ca{{\scriptsize>} \septuagint}{missing in the Septuagint} ``This one has come to stay, and he totally judges us!\understood\ Now, we will do evilly more so with you than with them!'' They strongly urged the man~--- Lot~--- and they drew near to break down the door.%%
    \verse{19:10} The men reached out\lit{stretched out their hands} and brought Lot into the house, to them, and closed the door.%%
    \verse{19:11} The men who were at the door of the house~--- from smallest to largest~--- were smitten with a dazzling light\ed{Other editions give ``blindness''} and they gave up\alt{got tired} looking for the door.%%
    \verse{19:12} The men said to Lot, ``Who else is here? A son-in-law,\alt{brother-in-law; although this doesn't make much contextual sense, especially given verse~14.} your sons, your daughters, and everyone you have in the city~--- bring them out of this\understood\ca{\sampen\septuagint\peshitta\ + \Hebrew{הזה} ut 13\thinspace.\thinspace14}{the Samaritan Pentateuch, Septuagint, and Peshitta all add ``this,'' as also in verses~13 and~14.} place%%
    \verse{19:13} because we are going to wipe this place out because their cries have been great before the \textsc{Lord}, so the \textsc{Lord} has sent us to wipe it\ca{\sampen\ \Hebrew{להשׁחיתה}; \vulgate\ suff 3 pl, 1 \Hebrew{תָם}---?}{the Samaritan Pentateuch gives a plural conjugation; the Vulgate has a third person plural suffix, and one (manuscript?) has a plural ending}\ed{This above note is significant because it means that there could possibly be more than one city being destroyed.} out.''%%
    \verse{19:14} Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law (those who had married his daughters), and said, ``Get up and get out of this place because the \textsc{Lord} is going to destroy the city.'' But, in his sons-in-laws' view, he was joking around.\ed{Both Lot and his daughters made a great decision with these guys.}%%
