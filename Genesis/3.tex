    \verse{3:1} The snake was subtler\alt{cleverer, shrewder} than all the other field animals that the \textsc{Lord} God had created. He\footnote{Theological implication here is that the snake, representing the adversary, is male; otherwise, ``she'' or ``it'' would be acceptable pronouns.} said to the woman, ``Has God really said that you shall not eat from every tree of the Garden?''%%
    \verse{3:2} The woman replied to the snake, ``We may eat the fruit of the trees\lit{From the fruit of the trees} of the garden,%%
    \verse{3:3} `but from the fruit of the tree that's in the middle of the garden,' God said, `don't eat it and don't touch it or else you'll die.'\thinspace''%%
    \verse{3:4} The snake said to the woman, ``You won't certainly die%%
    \verse{3:5} because God knows, rather, that\understood\ in the day you\heb{plural} eat from it, your eyes will be opened and you'll be like God, knowing good and evil.''%%
