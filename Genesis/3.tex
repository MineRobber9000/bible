    \verse{3:1} The snake was subtler\alt{cleverer, shrewder} than all the other field animals that the \textsc{Lord} God had created. He\footnote{Theological implication here is that the snake, representing the adversary, is male; otherwise, ``she'' or ``it'' would be acceptable pronouns.} said to the woman, ``Has God really said that you shall not eat from every tree of the Garden?''%%
    \verse{3:2} The woman replied to the snake, ``We may eat the fruit of the trees\lit{From the fruit of the trees} of the garden,%%
    \verse{3:3} `but from the fruit of the tree that's in the middle of the garden,' God said, `don't eat it and don't touch it or else you'll die.'\thinspace''%%
    \verse{3:4} The snake said to the woman, ``You won't certainly die%%
    \verse{3:5} because God knows that\heb{כִּי}{See further in Waltke and O'Connor 39.3.4.} when\lit{in the day} you\heb{plural}{} eat from it, your eyes will be opened and you'll be like God, knowing good and evil.''%%
    \verse{3:6} The woman saw that the tree was good for food, that it is wanting\alt{craving, longing, pleasant, beautiful, lovely} to the eyes~--- that the tree is pleasurable to make one wise. So she took some of its fruit and ate. She also gave some of it\understood\ to her husband who was\understood\ with her, and he ate.%%
    \verse{3:7} Both of their eyes were opened and they knew that they were naked. They sewed together fig leaves and made loincloths\alt{aprons, girdles} for themselves.%%
    \verse{3:8} They heard the voice of the \textsc{Lord} God, walking in the breeze of day.\footnote{It is unclear if this is the evening or morning wind. The Hebrew is \Hebrew{לְרוּחַ הַיּוֺם}, literally meaning ``in/during the wind/breeze of day.''} Adam and his wife were hiding themselves from the face of the \textsc{Lord} God who\understood\ was in the midst of the Garden.%%
    \verse{3:9} The \textsc{Lord} God called to Adam and said to him, ``Where are you?''%%
    \verse{3:10} And he replied, ``I heard your voice in the Garden and I was afraid because I'm naked~--- that's why\understood\ I hid.''\lit{hid myself.}%%
    \verse{3:11} He said, ``Who told you that you're naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you to not eat from?''\lit{From the tree that I commanded you to not eat from, have you eaten?}%%
    \verse{3:12} Adam said, ``The woman, whom you gave to me, she gave me fruit\understood\ from the tree and I ate.''%%
    \verse{3:13} The \textsc{Lord} God said to the woman, ``What is this that you've done?'' And the woman said, ``The snake tricked\alt{deceived. The niphal meaning is to ``give oneself false hopes.''} me and I ate.''%%
    \verse{3:14} The \textsc{Lord} God said to the snake,\smallskip%%
    
    \pvbd{``Because you've done this,}{you shall be cursed}{more than every animal,\footnotemark}{and more than every field animal.}
    \fntlit{from all the animals}%
    
    \pvbc{You shall go about on your belly}{and you shall eat loose soil\footnotemark}{all the days of your life.}
    \fntkb{loose \textbf{soil}, crumbling to \textbf{dust}.}
