\heading{13}{Abram's company and Lot return to the site of Abram's altar by Bethel and Ai~--- because of the overabundance of their property, they cannot live together~--- Abram and Lot's herders get in a fight and Abram and Lot go their separate ways~--- }

\begin{inparaenum}
    \verse{13:1} Abram~--- he, his wife, and everything\ed{everyone?} he had, and Lot with him~--- went up from Egypt towards the south.%%
    \verse{13:2} Abram was incredibly wealthy in cattle, in silver, in gold.%%
    \verse{13:3} He went on his journeys from the south all the way to\lit{as far as} Bethel, to the place that his tent had been at first, between Bethel and Ai,%%
    \verse{13:4} to the place of the altar that he had made there in the first place\lit{at first}~--- Abram there called on the name of the \textsc{Lord}.%%
    \verse{13:5} Also, Lot (who had gone with Abram) had sheep and cattle and tents.%%
    \verse{13:6} But the land could not support\alt{bear} them to live\alt{dwell, habitate} together because they had too many possessions,\lit{their property was too much} so they couldn't live together.\ed{There's an interesting principle here about only hol\kern0.025em ding onto what's most important to you: if they had sacrificed possessions in order to live together, would the incident at Sodom and Gomorrah have happened?}%%
    \verse{13:7} There was a dispute\halot{\textbf{dispute}, \textbf{quarrel} (in public, with words, complaints, assertions, reproaches)} between Abram's cattle herders and Lot's cattle herders (the Canaanite and the Perizzite were then dwelling in the land),%%
    \verse{13:8} and Abram said to Lot, ``Please don't let there be contention between me and you, between my herders and your herders, because we're brothers.%%
    \verse{13:9} Isn't the entire land before you? Please separate yourself from me. If you go to the left, I'll go to the right. If you go to the right, I'll go to the left.''%%
