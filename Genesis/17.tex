    \verse{Genesis^17:1} Abraham was 99 years old when the \textsc{Lord} appeared to him. He said, ``I am God Almighty\footnote{Omnipotent~--- pl. for violence XXXX=[check unabridged Kohler-Baumgartner]}~--- walk before Me and be perfect.%
    \verse{Genesis^17:2} I will give\footnote{set up, establish} My covenant between us and I will greatly multiply you.''%
    \verse{Genesis^17:3} Abraham fell on his face as God spoke with him, saying,%
    \verse{Genesis^17:4} ``Pay attention. My covenant is with you~--- you shall be like a father of a multitude of nations.%
    \verse{Genesis^17:5} You shall no longer be called Abram, but rather Abraham, for I have made you a father of a multitude of nations.%
    \verse{Genesis^17:6} You shall be exceedingly fruitful. You shall become many nations. Kings will be among your posterity.\footnote{lit., Kings will come from you.}%
    \verse{Genesis^17:7} I will establish a covenant between us and also between your offspring.\footnote{progeny} It shall be an everlasting covenant: to be the God of you and your children.%
    \verse{Genesis^17:8} I will give you and your descendants\footnote{lit, seed after thee} the land of your sojournings and the land of Canaan as an everlasting possession for I have become their God.''%
    \verse{Genesis^17:9} God said to Abraham, ``You and the generations that follow shall honor this covenant.%
    \verse{Genesis^17:10} This is My covenant, between Me and you and your progeny,\footnote{lit., your seed after you} that you shall observe carefully: every male shall be circumcised.''%
    \verse{Genesis^17:11} You shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin as a sign of the covenant between Me and you.%
    \verse{Genesis^17:12} Every male in your generations shall be circumcised when they are eight days old: those born in a house and those, not your offspring (the children of a stranger), that are bought with money.%
    \verse{Genesis^17:13} Those born in a house and those bought with your money shall certainly be circumcised. My covenant shall be an everlasting covenant in your flesh.%
    \verse{Genesis^17:14} The uncircumcised male, the flesh of whose foreskin is uncircumcised, shall be cut off\footnote{Great word choice} from My people: he has broken My covenant.%
    \verse{Genesis^17:15} God said to Abraham, ``Your wife will no longer be known as Sarai, but Sarah.%
    \verse{Genesis^17:16} I will bless her. Additionally, I will give you a son from her. I will bless her that she shall become a nation~--- people's kings will be among her posterity.''%
    \verse{Genesis^17:17} And Abraham fell on his face and laughed. He said in his heart, ``Shall a son be born to a hundred year old man? And shall a ninety year old woman bear him?''\footnote{More lit., Shall one be born to an hundred year old? Shall a daughter who is ninety bear?}%
    \verse{Genesis^17:18} Abraham said to God, ``O that Ishmael might live in Your presence!''%
