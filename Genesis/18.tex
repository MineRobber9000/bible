    \verse{18:1} The \textsc{Lord} appeared to him by the oaks\cf{\vref{Gen}{13}{18}} of Mamre as\lit{and} he sat in the opening of his tent in the heat of day.%%
    \verse{18:2} He looked up and saw three men standing near him. When he saw them, he ran from the tent door to meet them and bowed down to the earth.%%
    \verse{18:3} He said, ``O Lord, please, if I've found approval in your eyes, then please don't overlook your servant.\ca{\sampen\ \Hebrew{עבדכם}\textbf{\ \dots\ }\Hebrew{תעברו}\textbf{\ \dots\ }\Hebrew{בעיניכם}}{the Samaritan Pentateuch pluralizes this (i.e., your servants)}%%
    \verse{18:4} Please, let some water be brought and wash your feet and stretch out and rest under the tree,%%
    \verse{18:5} and I will get a piece of bread and strengthen\halot{with food} you. After that you can pass through because you have therefore passed by to your servant.'' And they said, ``Do as you've said.''%%
    \verse{18:6} Abraham hurried towards the tent to Sarah, and said, ``Hurry! Three seahs\halot{measure of capacity, in one estimate~= approximately 7~L, 7.5~qt} of wheat\halot{\textbf{fine}(-ground) \textbf{wheat flour}, ground from inner kernels of wheat} flour, knead it\understood\ and make bread-cakes.''%%
    \verse{18:7} Abraham ran to the herd and took a frail\alt{tender, weak} but\ed{This could easily be ``a tender \textit{and} good calf.''} good calf\lit{son of the herd} and gave it to the young man who\lit{and he} hurried and made it.%%
    \verse{18:8} He took curdled milk\halot{a type of \textbf{curdled milk}, similar to yogurt} and milk and the calf that he'd made and placed them before them; and he stood in front of them under the tree and they\ed{ambiguous} ate.%%
    \verse{18:9} They said to him, ``Where is your wife, Sarah?'' He said, ``She's\understood\ in the tent.''%%
    \verse{18:10} He said, ``I will definitely return to you at this\understood\ time of life, and your wife, Sarah, will have a child.'' And Sarah was listening from behind him at the tent door.%% xxxx ylt: verse 11 starts at "and sarah was listening"
    \verse{18:11} Abraham and Sarah were old, advanced in days, and Sarah had stopped menstruating.\lit{stopped had become to Sarah the way of women.}%%
    \verse{18:12} Sarah laughed\ed{There seems to be, especially in the context of verse~14, a connotation of doubt here.} to herself,\lit{on the inside} saying, ``After I've become old shall I really have sexual pleasure? My lord\ie{Abraham} is old!%%
    \verse{18:13} The \textsc{Lord} said to Abraham, ``Why has Sarah laughed, saying, `Am I really going to give birth now that I'm old?'%% verse 14 starts here at the beginning of this verse in ylt
    \verse{18:14} Is anything\lit{any (understood) matter/thing} too difficult\alt{hard} for the \textsc{Lord}? At the appointed time I will return to you~--- at the time of life~--- and Sarah will have a son.''%%
    \verse{18:15} But Sarah denied, saying, ``I didn't laugh'' (because she was afraid). And He said, ``No, you did laugh.''%%
    \verse{18:16} The men rose up from there and looked down\halot{\textbf{nif.}: \textbf{look down} with \textit{`al} on (suggesting: from point of view of one standing above, i.e., `look down there'): \haref{1S}{13}{18}. \textbf{hif.}: \textbf{look down} (suggesting: from point of view of one standing below, i.e., `look down here') \haref{Gn}{18}{16}.} on Sodom, and Abraham went with them to send them off.%%
    \verse{18:17} And the \textsc{Lord} said, ``Should I keep what I'm doing secret from Abraham%%
    \verse{18:18} because Abraham will certainly become a great and vast\alt{mighty} nation, and all the nation of the earth will be blessed through him?%%
    \verse{18:19} Because I have covenanted\ed{\Hebrew{xxxx yada} literally means to know, but it here means it in a covenental sense. See further in Appendix~\ref{app:covenants-in-antiquity}.} with him so that he will command his children and household after him that\lit{and, but can be just about any conjugation} they keep the way of the \textsc{Lord}: to do righteousness and justice so that the \textsc{Lord} can bring to pass\lit{on} that which He has spoken concerning him.''%%
    \verse{18:20} The \textsc{Lord} said, ``Sodom and Gomorrah's call for help\ca{\sampen\ \Hebrew{xxxx} cf 21}{the Samaritan Pentateuch gives \Hebrew{xxxx} [cry for help, call for help (mostly to God)], compare verse~21} is great and their sin is very great.%%
