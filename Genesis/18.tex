    \verse{18:1} The \textsc{Lord} appeared to him by the oaks\cf{\vref{Gen}{13}{18}} of Mamre as\lit{and} he sat in the opening of his tent in the heat of day.%%
    \verse{18:2} He looked up and saw three men standing near him. When he saw them, he ran from the tent door to meet them and bowed down to the earth.%%
    \verse{18:3} He said, ``O Lord, please, if I've found approval in your eyes, then please don't overlook your servant.\ca{\sampen\ \Hebrew{עבדכם}\textbf{\ \dots\ }\Hebrew{תעברו}\textbf{\ \dots\ }\Hebrew{בעיניכם}}{the Samaritan Pentateuch pluralizes this (i.e., your servants)}%%
    \verse{18:4} Please, let some water be brought and wash your feet and stretch out and rest under the tree,%%
    \verse{18:5} and I will get a piece of bread and strengthen\halot{with food} you. After that you can pass through because you have therefore passed by to your servant.'' And they said, ``Do as you've said.''%%
