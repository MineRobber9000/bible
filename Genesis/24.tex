\heading{24}{Abraham commands his servant to find a wife for his son~--- xxxx}

\begin{inparaenum}
    \verse{24:1} Abraham grew old, come into days; and the \textsc{Lord} blessed Abraham in everything.%%
    \verse{24:2} Abraham said to his servant, the oldest in his house who governed his house and everything he had,\lit{on all which was to him} ``Please place your hand under my thigh\halot{area of sexual organs (hand placed there in oaths)}\ed{This is theologically incorrect: the Lord wouldn't require inappropriate touching to make oaths; in my opinion, this word was either changed throughout time or the original meaning was lost somewhere along the way.}%%
    \verse{24:3} and I will cause you to swear by the \textsc{Lord}, God of Heaven and God of the earth, that you won't take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites in whose midst I'm living:%%
    \verse{24:4} but you shall go to my land, to my family, and take a wife for my son, for Isaac.''%%
    \verse{24:5} The servant said to him, ``Maybe the woman won't want to follow me\lit{after me} to this land. Should I again return your son to the land that you came out of?''%%
    \verse{24:6} But Abraham said to him, ``Watch yourself lest you make my son return back here.%%
    \verse{24:7} The \textsc{Lord}, God of Heaven,\ca{\missing\ cod Sev; prb ins \Hebrew{הָאָרֶץ} \Hebrew{וֵאלֹהֵי} ut 3, it \septuagint}{missing in ancient, Sev(xxxx?) manuscripts; probably inserts ``the God of the earth'' like in verse~3, likewise in the Septuagint} who has taken me from the house of my fathers and the land of my birth;\ca{cod Sev \Hebrew{וּמֵאַרְצִי} \Hebrew{מִבֵּיתִי}}{ancient, Sev(xxxx?) manuscripts have ``from my house and from my land''} who's promised\alt{spoken to} me and sworn to me, saying, `I will give this land to your posterity.' He will send His messenger before you and you will take a wife from there for my son.%%
    \verse{24:8} If the woman doesn't want to follow after you, then\understood\ you will be free\halot{\textbf{be free} of, \textbf{exempt} from: be free of the obligation of an oath \haref{Gn}{24}{8}} from this oath of mine: just\alt{only} don't bring back my son.''%%
    \verse{24:9} The servant placed his hand under his master, Abraham's thigh, and swore to him regarding this matter.%%
    
    \verse{24:10} The servant took ten camels (from his lord's camels) and left.\ca{\missing\ \septuagint, prp dl}{[``and left'' is] missing in the Septuagint, it's been proposed to delete it} And all\ca{\peshitta(\vulgate) \textit{wmn kl}, prp \Hebrew{וּמִכָּל}}{the Peshitta (and Vulgate) have ``from all'', it's been proposed to be ``and from all''}\ed{This works best if both \textsc{ca} propositions are kept.} the goods of his lord in his hand, and he got up and went too Aram-Naharaim, to the city of Nahor.%%
    \verse{24:11} He made the camels kneel outside the city by well of water in the\lit{at} evening when the women go out to draw water.\halot{\textit{`\=et \d s\=e't \v s\=o'\super{e}b\^ot} = time when the women come forth to draw water \haref{Gn}{24}{11}}%%
    \verse{24:12} He said, ``O \textsc{Lord}, God of my master Abraham, please let something happen for me\halot{let something happen = \textbf{ordain}, \textbf{direct}: with \textit{l\super{e}f\=anay} for me \haref{Gn}{24}{12}} today; deal kindly with my master, Abraham.%%
    \verse{24:13} I'm standing by the well of water, and the daughters of the men of the city are going out to draw water.%%
    \verse{24:14} And the maid\ca{\sampen\ ut Q, K \Hebrew{הַנַּעַר}?}{the Samaritan Pentateuch is as read, but written as ``[masculine] servant''?} to whom I will say,\lit{the maid who I have spoken to her} `Please tilt\halot{\textbf{incline}, \textbf{bend down}: object pitcher, tilt \haref{Gn}{24}{12} [should be 14]} your pitcher\halot{\textbf{large} (pottery) \textbf{jar}, for water \haref{Gn}{24}{14}} and I will drink'; and she will say, `Drink, and I will also get water\alt{drink} for your camels.' Let it be her whom You shall determine for Your servant~--- for Isaac. I shall know because\lit{by} of this that You've dealt kindly with my master.''%%
    \verse{24:15} Before he'd finished speaking\ca{\sampen\septuagint\vulgate\ + \Hebrew{אֶל־לִבּוֺ} cf 45}{the Samaritan Pentateuch, Septuagint, and Vulgate add ``to him,'' (xxxx right?) compare verse~45} Rebecca (who was born to Bethuel, the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother) came out with a pitcher on her shoulder.%%
    \verse{24:16} The maid had a really good appearance, and was a virgin (no man had had intercourse with her). She went down to the fountain, filled her pitcher, and went up.%%
    \verse{24:17} The servant ran to meet her, and said, ``Please let me sip a little water from your jug.''%%
    \verse{24:18} And she said, ``Drink, my lord,'' and she quickly let her pitcher down into\alt{onto} her hand, and gave him drink.%%
    \verse{24:19} When she finished giving him drink, she said, ``I will also draw water\understood\ for your camels until they've finished drinking.''%%
