    \verse{9:2} Let the fear and horror of you be on every large animal of the earth, and on every bird in the sky, upon\ed{The critical apparatus states, ``2 Mss \sampen$^\text{Mss}$ \Hebrew{ובכל}'' (two manuscripts of the Samaritan Pentateuch manuscripts include ``\Hebrew{ובכל}'' [meaning that ``and'' is present]).} everything that is teeming on the ground, and every fish in the water: they are placed into your stewardship.\lit{hand.}%%
    \verse{9:3} Every teeming thing that is alive shall be food for you. As to the vegetables, I give them all\ed{Interestingly, ``all'' is the direct object of this sentence.} to you.%%
    \verse{9:4} However, live animals\lit{animals in their life}~--- their blood~--- you shall not eat.%%
    \verse{9:5} Indeed, your blood~--- your life blood\understood~--- I demand. I demand it from the hand of every living thing. From man's hand, from the hand of each\understood\ man's brother, I demand the life of man.%%
    
    \pvcb{\vn{9:6} Whoever sheds a man's blood,}{his blood shall be shed by a man,}%%

    \verse{9:8} God spoke to Noah and to his children with him, saying,%%
    \verse{9:9} ``I, yes I, will establish My covenant with you and your progeny after you~---%%
    \verse{9:10} with every living animal that is with you, the birds, large animals, and all the animals of the earth that\understood\ are with you~--- with everything that has gone out of the Ark: every animal of the earth.%%
    \verse{9:11} I will establish My covenant with you: never again shall anything\lit{all flesh; but meaning every man, beast, bird, etc., and therefore ``anything.''} be cut off by the waters of the Flood. There shall never again be a flood to destroy the earth.''%%
    \verse{9:12} God said, ``This is the sign of the covenant that I am offering\alt{presenting, setting, giving} between Me and you and every living animal that is with you, to generations everlasting:%%
    \verse{9:13} I set My rainbow\halot{metaphorical interpretation of ``bow.''} in the clouds,\halot{(mass of) \textbf{clouds}} and it shall be for a sign of the covenant between Me and the earth.%%
    \verse{9:14} When I cause the clouds to make an appearance over the earth, I will make the rainbow appear\lit{seen} in the clouds.%%
    \verse{9:15} I will remember the covenant that is between Me and you and every living animal of all flesh. The waters shall never again be a flood and destroy every man and animal.%%
    \verse{9:16} The rainbow shall be in the cloud and I shall see it to remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living soul of all flesh that is on the earth.''%%

    \verse{9:20} Noah began to be a man of the earth and planted a vineyard.%%
