    \verse{16:1} Sarai, Abram's wife, hadn't borne any children to him; but she had an Egyptian slave\halot{\textbf{female slave}, \textbf{maidservant} (not clearly distinguished from \textit{'\=am\^ a})} named\lit{whose name was} Hagar.%%
    \verse{16:2} Sarai said to Abram, ``The \textsc{Lord} has made me barren. Please go in to my slave so that I might be built up from her.'' And Abram listened to Sarai's counsel.\lit{sound, voice, call; but none of these make sense in context.}\ed{Do you think Abram immediately listened and just went for it, or was this a longer conversation? I could see it going both ways: he's spent so much time pleading with the Lord and now his wife is opening up a path so that he can receive these blessings so he just goes for it; alternatively, he's spent so much time talking about this with God and meditating that there's no way he just rushes into anything because that hasn't been his style all along.}%%
    \verse{16:3} Abram's wife, Sarai, took her Egyptian slave, Hagar, (at the end of tenth year that Abram had lived in the land of Canaan) and gave her to her husband, Abram, to be his wife.%%
