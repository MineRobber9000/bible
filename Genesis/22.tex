\begin{enumerate}
    \verse{Genesis^22:1} After these things, God tested Abraham. He said to him, ``Abraham'' and Abraham replied, ``Yes?''\footnote{He says ``\Hebrew{הִנֵּֽנִי}'' which means anything from ``Behold!'' to ``I am here'' to ``Pay attention.'' It's a pretty all inclusive word with ``Yes?'' being an appropriate, idiomatic response.}%
    \verse{Genesis^22:2} He said, ``Please take your son Isaac~--- your only son~--- whom you love,\footnote{This is poignantly repetitive.} and get you yonder\footnote{lit., ``go for thyself''} to the land of Moriah. You shall raise him up as a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I shall tell you.''%
    \verse{Genesis^22:3} So Abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his donkey. He took two of his young servants and his son Isaac with him. He chopped up some wood for the burnt offering, rose, and went to the place where God told him.%
    \verse{Genesis^22:4} On the third day, Abraham looked up\footnote{lifted up his eyes} and saw the place afar off.\footnote{``from afar,'' but this is written from his perspective}%
    \verse{Genesis^22:5} Abraham said to his young servants, ``Stay here with the donkey while the boy and I go off, worship, and return.''%
    \verse{Genesis^22:6} Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and had his son Isaac carry it.\footnote{lit, placed it on his son Isaac} He took some fire, a knife, and the both of them went off together.%
    \verse{Genesis^22:7} Isaac said to Abraham, ``Dad?'' and he responded, ``Yes, my son?'' \footnote{``And Isaac said'' has been removed to help the flow.}``I see the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?''%
    \verse{Genesis^22:8} Abraham replied, ``My son, God Himself will provide a lamb for the burnt offering'' and they went on together.%
    \verse{Genesis^22:9} They came to the place which God had before told them and Abraham built an altar and arranged the wood. Then he bound Isaac and placed him on the wood on the altar.%
    \verse{Genesis^22:10} And Abraham took the knife in his hand to slay his son.%
    \verse{Genesis^22:11} The messenger of the \textsc{Lord} called to him from the heavens and said, ``Abraham! Abraham!'' and he said, ``Yes?''%
    \verse{Genesis^22:12} \footnote{``He said''}``Don't slay\footnote{lit., put forth your hand} the boy, neither do anything to him because now I know that you fear God~--- you have not withheld your son~--- your only son~--- from me.''%
