    \verse{20:1} Abraham traveled from there towards the south\lit{the land to the south} and stayed between Kadesh and Shur and lived in Gerar.%%
    \verse{20:2} Abraham said regarding his wife, Sarah, ``She's my sister.''\ed{This word can refer to any female relative.} And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah.%%
    \verse{20:3} So God came to Abimelech by night in a dream, and said to him, ``You're dead because of the woman whom you've taken~--- she's married to a husband.''%%
    \verse{20:4} But Abimelech hadn't come near to her\halot{to a woman (for sexual intercourse) \haref{Gn}{20}{4}} so he said, ``Lord,\ca{nonn Mss \Hebrew{יהוה}}{a few manuscripts have the Tetragrammaton} will You also kill a righteous nation?\ed{I doubt this is hyperbole. Gerar is almost certainly righteous and led by a righteous man. See verses~5--6.}%%
    \verse{20:5} Didn't he say to me, `She's my sister'? And she, even she said, `He's my brother'! With my blameless\alt{pure, complete, right, sound, orderly}\ylt{integrity} heart and with my innocent hands have I done this.''%%
    \verse{20:6} And God said to him in a dream, ``I, too, know that you've done this with your blameless heart; and I, too, have restrained you\alt{held you back} from sinning against Me. Therefore, I haven't allowed\alt{permitted} you to touch her.%%
