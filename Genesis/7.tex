    \verse{7:1} The \textsc{Lord} said to Noah, ``You and all of your household, go into the Ark because I've seen you\ed{singular} righteous before Me in this generation.%%
    \verse{7:2} Of all the large, clean\ie{cultically, ritualistically} animals, you shall bring seven pairs\lit{seven seven} with\lit{to} you, male and female.\ed{What kind of split? It would make sense to bring more females than males.} But of the beasts that are not clean, you shall bring\understood\ two, male and female.%%
    \verse{7:3} Additionally, bring\understood\ the birds of the sky by sevens, male and female, in order to keep offspring alive on the face of all the earth.%%
    \verse{7:4} Because \lit{in}seven days hence I will let it rain for forty days and forty nights on the earth, until\ed{The conjuctive \textit{waw} (\Hebrew{וְ})) is generally rendered ``and,'' but can also be used to show the consequences of actions, so I feel justified in rendering it as ``until'' here.} everything living\halot{\textbf{what subsists}, \textbf{what is living}} that I have made is destroyed from off the face of the land.''%%
    \verse{7:5} So Noah did according to everything that the \textsc{Lord} had commanded him.%%
    
    \verse{7:6} Noah was\lit{was a son of} 600~years old when the deluge of waters was\ed{Not necessarily ``began'' because the Flood only lasted 40~days. This is simply saying that the Flood happened during the 600$^\text{th}$ year of Noah's life.} on the earth.%%
