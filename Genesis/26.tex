    \verse{26:3} Stay\halot{\textbf{stay as foreigner and sojourner}} in this land. I will be with you. I will bless you, because I will give all these lands to you and your posterity~--- I will carry out the oath\alt{swearing} that I swore to your father Abraham.%%
    \verse{26:4} I will multiply your posterity as the stars in the sky.\alt{heavens} I will give all these lands to your posterity. All the nations of the earth shall wish a blessing to themselves [because of] your posterity.\ed{This is a bit confusing and \textsc{halot} isn't too helpful. It gives this \textit{hithpael} form as meaning ``\textbf{wish a blessing to oneself} (to one another?), with \textit{b}\superit{e} \haref{Gn}{22}{18} (Abraham)\haref{}{26}{4} (Isaac)'' which is where I derived the present translation from.}%%
