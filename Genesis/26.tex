    \verse{26:1} There was a famine in the land, besides the previous famine that had happened\lit{been} in Abraham's days. So Isaac went to Gerar, to Abimelech king of the Philistines.\lit{to Abimelech king of the Philistines to Gerar.}%%
    \verse{26:2} But the \textsc{Lord} appeared to him and said, ``Don't go down to Egypt; stay in the land that I will tell you.%%
    \verse{26:3} Stay\halot{\textbf{stay as foreigner and sojourner}} in this land. I will be with you. I will bless you, because I will give all these lands to you and your posterity~--- I will carry out the oath\alt{swearing} that I swore to your father Abraham.%%
    \verse{26:4} I will multiply your posterity as the stars in the sky.\alt{heavens} I will give all these lands to your posterity. All the nations of the earth shall wish a blessing to themselves [because of] your posterity.\ed{This is a bit confusing and \textsc{halot} isn't too helpful. It gives this \textit{hithpael} form as meaning ``\textbf{wish a blessing to oneself} (to one another?), with \textit{b}\superit{e} \haref{Gn}{22}{18} (Abraham)\haref{}{26}{4} (Isaac)'' which is where I derived the present translation from.}%%
    \verse{26:5} Because that Abraham\ca{\sampen\septuagint\ + \Hebrew{אָבִיךָ}}{the Samaritan Pentateuch and Septuagint add ``your father''} heard My voice and obeyed My statutes and My commandments and My laws.''%%
    \verse{26:6} Isaac lived in Gerar.%%
    \verse{26:7} The men of the place asked him about his wife, and he said, ``She is my sister'' because he was afraid to say ``My wife,\ca{ins c \sampen\septuagint\ \Hebrew{הִיא}}{insert with the Samaritan Pentateuch and Septuagint ``she [is]''} lest the men of the place kill me for Rebecca because she's beautiful.''\lit{of good appearance.''}%%
    \verse{26:8} When he'd been there a while,\lit{When the days became long to him there} Abimelech king of the Philistines looked down through his window and saw Isaac was fondling\halot{with \textit{'}\superit{\=e}\textit{t} \textbf{fondle} (a woman) \haref{Gn}{26}{8}} his wife Rebecca.%%
    \verse{26:9} Abimelech called to Isaac, and said, ``She's definitely\lit{surely} your wife! Why\lit{How} did you say, `She's my sister'?'' And Isaac said to him, ``Because I said, `Lest I die for her.'\thinspace''%%
    \verse{26:10} Abimelech said, ``What is this thing you've done to us? One of the people, like nothing,\lit{like a little thing} could have laid with your wife, and you would have brought guilt on us.''%%
    \verse{26:11} So Abimelech commanded all the people,\ca{\sampen\septuagint\ \Hebrew{עַמּוֺ}}{the Samaritan Pentateuch and Septuagint have ``his people''} saying, ``Whoever touches this man or his wife shall certainly be killed.''\lit{shall die the death.''}%%
    \verse{26:12} Isaac sowed in that land and found a hundredfold in that field; the \textsc{Lord} blessed him.%%
    \verse{26:13} The man became great, becoming continually greater, until he had become very great.%%
    \verse{26:14} He had possession of a flock and possession of a herd and many servants. The Philistines envied him.%%
