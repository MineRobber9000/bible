    \verse{31:12} The \textsc{Lord} spoke to Moses, saying,%%
    \verse{31:13} ``You, speak to the children of Israel, saying, `Surely, you shall keep My Sabbaths because this is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations that\understood\ you may know that I am the \textsc{Lord} who sanctifies you.%%
    \verse{31:14} Keep the Sabbath because it is holy\alt{sanctifying} to you. Everyone who profanes it shall surely be put to death.\alt{die.}\ed{I like this more as ``be put to death'' because it shows that someone has to kill the commandment breaker other than the Lord.} Because whoever does work on it, that person shall be cut off from among his people.%%
    \verse{31:15} Six days is work done,\ca{\septuagint\ 2 sg et \peshitta\vulgate\ 2 pl act}{the Septuagint is in second person singular, while the Peshitta and Vulgate are in second person plural active} but the seventh day is the Sabbath, a day\understood\ of rest, holy to the \textsc{Lord}. Anyone who does work on the sabbath day will certainly be put to death.%%
