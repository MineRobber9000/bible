    \verse{Exodus^19:1} In the third month since the departure of the children of Israel from the land of Egypt,\footnote{in that day} they came into the Sinai wilderness.%
    \verse{Exodus^19:2} They left Rephidim, came into the Sinai wilderness, and camped there\footnote{in the Sinai wilderness.} before the mountain.%
    \verse{Exodus^19:3} And Moses went up to God, and the \textsc{Lord} called unto him from the mountain, saying, "Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Jacob, and tell unto the sons of Israel:%
    \verse{Exodus^19:4} XXXX%
    \verse{Exodus^19:5} And now, if thou shalt truly obey me and keep\footnote{observe} my commandments, thou shalt be\footnote{to me} a treasure{Refers to a temple treasure. This has covenantal implications.} from among all people\footnote{above all people} for all the earth is mine.%
    \verse{Exodus^19:6} And thou\footnote{\emph{pl.}} shalt be\footnote{to me} a kingdom of priests and an holy nation. These words shalt thou say unto the children of Israel."%
    \verse{Exodus^19:7} And Moses entered in\footnote{i.e., to the camp} and called unto the elders of the people and laid before them all these things that the \textsc{Lord} had commanded him.%%
    \verse{Exodus^19:8} Then all the people answered together, saying, ``All that the \textsc{Lord} hath said we will do.'' So Moses returned what the people said\footnote{the words of the people} to the \textsc{Lord}.%
    \verse{Exodus^19:9} The \textsc{Lord} said unto Moses, "I will come unto thee in a thick cloud so that the people may hear my words when I shall speak with thee. And they shall believe thee forever. Then Moses told the words of the people unto the \textsc{Lord}.%
    \verse{Exodus^19:10} And the \textsc{Lord} said unto Moses, "Go to the people and sanctify them today and tomorrow. Let them wash their clothes,%
    \verse{Exodus^19:11} for on the third day, the \textsc{Lord} will descend in the eyes of all the people before Mount Sinai.%
    \verse{Exodus^19:12} And thou shalt set bounds around the people XXXX to say, "Hearken to them XXXX in the mountain and anyone touching its edge\footnote{i.e., of the mountain} will surely be put to death.%
    \verse{Exodus^19:13} A hand will not touch it\footnote{the mountain} or he\footnote{whomever touches it} will surely be stoned or shot:\footnote{with arrows} whether beast or man, it shall not live while the trumpet sounds\footnote{continues} as they approach the mountain.%
    \verse{Exodus^19:14} So Moses went down from the mountain to the people and sanctified\footnote{consecrated, made holy} the people. And they washed their clothes.\footnote{As a way of preparing themselves to go up into the mountain.}%
    \verse{Exodus^19:15} And he said unto the people, ``Prepare yourselves: for three days do not approach a woman.''%
    \verse{Exodus^19:16} On the third morning, when it was morning, there were noises and flashes of lightning, a thick cloud over the mountain, and a very powerful sound of a trumpet:\footnote{One used for ritualistic purposes.} and all the people in the camp were afraid.%
    \verse{Exodus^19:17} Moses brought the people out from the camp to meet God and they stationed themselves at the base of the mountain.%
    \verse{Exodus^19:18} And Mount Sinai, all of it, was smoking because the \textsc{Lord} descended on it in fire. And the smoke went up like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount shook.%
    \verse{Exodus^19:19} The sound of the trumpet grew continually stronger\footnote{more and more powerful} while Moses spoke and God answered him.\footnote{with a voice}%
    \verse{Exodus^19:20} And the \textsc{Lord} descended upon the summit of Mount Sinai and\footnote{\dots the \textsc{Lord}\dots} called unto Moses.\footnote{at the summit} Moses went up.%
    \verse{Exodus^19:21} The \textsc{Lord} said unto Moses, ``Go down and solemnly charge the people lest they break through to see the \textsc{Lord} and many of them perish.''\footnote{Not because of some great iniquity, merely because of the glory of the \textsc{Lord} and His inherent power.}%
    \verse{Exodus^19:22} And also the priests... XXXX%
    \verse{Exodus^19:23} Moses said to the \textsc{Lord}, ``The people will not be able to come up to Mount Sinai because thou hast charged us, saying, `Make a border around the mount and sanctify it.'$\,$''%
    \verse{Exodus^19:24} The \textsc{Lord} saith unto him, ``Go down — you and Aaron with you — and the priests will come up. Let not the people break through to go up to the \textsc{Lord} lest His glory break out against them.''%
    \verse{Exodus^19:25} So Moses went down to the people and he spoke unto them.%
