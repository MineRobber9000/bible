    \verse{33:1} The \textsc{Lord} spoke to Moses: ``Leave, get up from here, you and this people whom you've brought out from the land of Egypt to the land that I've promised\alt{sworn} to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, `I will give it to your posterity,'%%
    \verse{33:2} (I have sent an\ca{\septuagint\ + sugg 1 sg}{the Septuagint adds a first person singular pronominal suffix [i.e., ``my angel'']} angel before you and driven the Canaanites, Amorites, Hittites,\ca{\sampen\ + \Hebrew{וְהַגִּרְגָּשִׁי} cf \septuagint}{the Samaritan Pentateuch adds ``Gergeshites,'' compare the Septuagint} Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites out)%%
    \verse{33:3} to a land flowing with milk and honey because I don't go up in your midst because you are a difficult and obstinate\alt{stiff-necked} people, lest I consume you in the way.''%%
    \verse{33:4} The people heard\alt{obeyed} these evil words and mourned, and no one put on their ornaments.%%
    \verse{33:5} So the \textsc{Lord} said to Moses: ``Say to the children of Israel: `You are a difficult and obstinate people: if I come into your midst for one instant,\alt{moment} I will consume you. So now, remove your ornaments\lit{from on you} and I will know what to do to you.'\thinspace''%%
    \verse{33:6} The children of Israel were stripped of their ornaments at Mount Horeb.%%
    
    \verse{33:7} Moses took the Tabernacle and pitched it outside the camp, far from the camp, and called it the Tent of Meeting. Everyone seeking the \textsc{Lord} went out to the Tent of Meeting that was outside the camp.\ed{You have to work to get to the temple.}%%
    \verse{33:8} When Moses went out to the tent, all of the people stood\alt{arose}~--- each man standing at the entrance of his tent~--- watching after Moses until he'd entered the tent.%%
    \verse{33:9} When Moses had entered the tent, the pillar of the cloud came down and stood at the opening of the tent, and He\ed{understood. It's conjugated 3ms and it's already known (context) that the Lord is in the pillar: this isn't a leap.} spoke with Moses.%%
    \verse{33:10} All of the people saw the pillar of the cloud standing at the opening of the tent; additionally, all of the people got up and everyone\lit{each man} prostrated themselves\alt{bowed, worshiped}\ed{The rendering that the people worshiped the Lord doesn't seem likely since they were previously murmuring about what He'd commanded them; they don't want to obey and it's more likely that they are here prostrating themselves in fear than bowing in heartfelt worship.} at the door of their\lit{3ms} tent.%%
    \verse{33:11} And the \textsc{Lord} spoke to Moses face to face like a man speaks to his friend; and he returned to the camp, but his attendant\alt{minister} Joshua, son of Nun, a kid, didn't leave the tent.\lit{didn't depart from the tent.}%%
    
    \verse{33:12} Moses said to the \textsc{Lord}, ``Look, You say to me: `Bring up this people,' but You haven't let me know\lit{caused me to know} who You'll send with me. You've said, `I know you by name, and you've also found favor in my eyes.'%%
