    \verse{5:6} \textsc{Preface.} I am the \textsc{Lord} your God. I brought you out from the land of Egypt~--- from the house of captivity.%%
    \verse{5:7} \textsc{i.} There will be no other gods in preference to me.%%
    \verse{5:8} \textsc{ii.} Never make for yourselves graven images, or any image,\footnote{an idol, picture, image, or any likeness} in the heavens above, neither that is in the earth nor the waters underneath the earth.%%
    \verse{5:9} Never bow down to them or worship\footnote{serve} them because I, the \textsc{Lord} your God, am a jealous God: I visit the punishment\footnote{iniquity} unto the third and fourth generation of my haters%%
    \verse{5:10} Showing mercy unto thousands who love me and obey my commandments.%%
    \verse{5:11} \textsc{iii.} Never take the name of the \textsc{Lord} thy God with vain purpose for the \textsc{Lord} shall not hold him guiltless who uses His name to vain purpose.%%
    \verse{5:12} \textsc{iv.} Keep the Sabbath day holy, just as the \textsc{Lord} your God has commanded you.%%
    \verse{5:13} You shall work and perform all your responsibilities\footnote{tasks, errands} in six days,%%
    \verse{5:14} but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the \textsc{Lord} your God: you shouldn't work, neither your son, daughter, handmaid, ox, donkey, any of your cattle, nor an outsider who's living in Israel. This so that your manservant and maidservant may rest just like you.%%
    \verse{5:15} Remember when you were slaves in the land of Egypt and the \textsc{Lord} your God brought you from there with a strong hand and an outstretched arm.\footnote{So that He can show the way; fight our battles} Therefore the \textsc{Lord} your God has commanded you to keep the Sabbath day.%%
    \verse{5:16} \textsc{v.} Take your mom and dad seriously just as the \textsc{Lord} your God has commanded you. This that your days may be lengthened and in order that it may be well for you upon the land which the \textsc{Lord} your God is going to give you.%%
    \verse{5:17} \textsc{vi.} Don't murder.%%
    \verse{5:18} \textsc{vii.} Don't commit adultery.%%
    \verse{5:19} \textsc{viii.} And don't steal.%%
    \verse{5:20} \textsc{ix.} Never give a vain witness against your neighbor.%%
    \verse{5:21} \textsc{x.} Don't desire your neighbor's wife or his house, field, bondman, handmaid, ox, donkey, or anything that's his.%%
