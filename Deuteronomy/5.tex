    \verse{Deuteronomy^5:6} \textsc{Preface.} I am the \textsc{Lord} your God. I brought you out from the land of Egypt~--- from the house of captivity.%
    \verse{Deuteronomy^5:7} \textsc{i.} There will be no other gods in preference to me.%
    \verse{Deuteronomy^5:8} \textsc{ii.} Never make for yourselves graven images, or any image,\footnote{an idol, picture, image, or any likeness} in the heavens above, neither that is in the earth nor the waters underneath the earth.%
    \verse{Deuteronomy^5:9} Never bow down to them or worship\footnote{serve} them because I, the \textsc{Lord} your God, am a jealous God: I visit the punishment\footnote{iniquity} unto the third and fourth generation of my haters%
