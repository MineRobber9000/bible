    \verse{25:5} When brothers dwell together\footnote{This does not necessarily denote two men with the same parents. It is merely male relatives. Same goes for whenever sister-in-law is said: it is a female relative.} and one of them dies and he has no son\footnote{there is not a son to him}, his wife shall not go unto foreigners\footnote{outside} to find a husband, but her brother-in-law will come to her and he shall take her unto himself as a wife. And thus\footnote{``Thus'' is not in the verse, but helps the flow.} shall he perform the duty of a brother-in-law.%%
    \verse{25:6} He shall raise up for the deceased\footnote{over the name of the deceased} the oldest child that she shall bear that his\footnote{i.e., the deceased} name be not erased from Israel.\footnote{Lit., The oldest child that she shall bear, he shall raise up for the deceased that his name be not erased from Israel.}%%
    \verse{25:7} And if the man is not inclined\footnote{pleased} to take his sister-in-law then let her\footnote{Lit., his sister-in-law} go up to the gate to the elders and say, ``My brother-in-law hath refused to raise up into his brother a name in Israel.''%%
    \verse{25:8} The elders of the city will call for him and he will stand and he shall say, ``I do not desire to take her.''%%
    \verse{25:9} Then his sister-in-law will approach him in the eyes\footnote{presence} of the elders and she will remove his sandal from off his foot. And she shall spit in his face and say\footnote{and she will answer and say}, ``So shall it be done\footnote{it is done} to the man who will not build up the house of his brother.''%%
    \verse{25:10} And his name will be called \textit{The house of the man whose sandal was removed.}%%
