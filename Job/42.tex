    \verse{42:1} Job answered the \textsc{Lord}, and said,\smallskip%%
    
    \pvbb{\vn{42:2} ``I know that You can do anything,}{no plan[/intention] is impossible for you.}%%
    
    \pvbb{\vn{42:3} Who's this who [understood] hides counsel without knowledge?}{Therefore, I have declared and not understood; things too(?) wonderful to me that I don't know [about?].}%%
    
    \pvbb{\vn{42:4} Please hear me and I will speak~---}{I will ask You and You will let me know.}%%
    
    \pvbb{\vn{42:5} By the hearing of the ear I'd heard of You,}{but now my eyes have seen You.}%%
    
    \pvbb{\vn{42:6} Therefore, I hate [myself?] and have repented}{in dust and ashes.''}%%
    
    \verse{42:7} After the \textsc{Lord} had spoken these words to Job [direction wrong?], the \textsc{Lord} said to Eliphaz the Temanite: ``My anger has burned against you and your two friends because you haven't spoken well of Me like My servant Job.%%
    \verse{42:8} So now, take seven bulls and seven rams and go to My servant Job and make a burnt offering ascend for you; My servant Job will pray for you because I will definitely accept him:\lit{his face:} otherwise I will do with you disdainfully(?) because you haven't spoken well of Me like My servant Job.''%%
    \verse{42:9} So Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, Zophar the Naamathite, went and did as the \textsc{Lord} had told them, and the \textsc{Lord} accepted Job.%%
