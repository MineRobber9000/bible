    \verse{1:6} There was a day when the sons of God came to appear before the \textsc{Lord}, and Satan also came among them.%%
    \verse{1:7} The \textsc{Lord} said to Satan, ``Where are you coming from?'' Satan answered the \textsc{Lord}, and said, ``From roaming around in the earth, going about in it.''%%
    \verse{1:8} The \textsc{Lord} said to Satan, ``Have you considered\lit{placed your heart on/against}\alt{paid attention to} my servant Job? Because there is no one like him in the world: a blameless\alt{pure, perfect, complete} and upright man who\understood\ fears God and desists\alt{leaves off} from evil.''%%
    \verse{1:9} Satan answered the \textsc{Lord}, and said, ``Does Job fear God without cause?\alt{without compensation, for nothing/naught, in vain?}%%
    \verse{1:10} Have You made a hedge round about him and his home and everything he has? You've blessed the works of his hands, his substance increases\alt{is spread out} in the land.%%
    \verse{1:11} xxxx please, stretch out Your hand and afflict\alt{touch, hurt, buffet} everything he has to see\understood\ if he'll bless\ca{correctio vel euphemismus pro \Hebrew{וְקִלְלוּ} vel sim}{correction or euphemism for ``cursed'' or a similar word} You to Your face.''%%
    \verse{1:12} The \textsc{Lord} said to Satan, ``Everything he has is in your power, just don't lay a hand on him.''\lit{only on him don't put your hand.''} So Satan went out from the presence of the \textsc{Lord}.%%
