    \verse{3:1} Joshua got up early in the morning. He, and all the children of Israel, journeyed from Shittim until they came to Jordan where\footnote{Understood} they passed the night\footnote{lit., they passed the night there} before passing through.%%
    \verse{3:2} At the end of three days, the officers\footnote{alt., record-keepers} passed through into the midst of the camp%%
    \verse{3:3} and commanded the people, saying, ``When you see the Ark of the Covenant of the \textsc{Lord} your God with the priests and Levites carrying it, and they journey from where you are:\footnote{lit., your place} you shall follow them.%%
    \verse{3:4} However, there shall be a distance between you and \footnote{lit., between}them~--- by measurement, about 2\hspace*{0.25em}000\hspace{0.5em}cu\-bits.\footnote{A little over half a mile (0.568\,mi). At a good walking pace, that's about ten minutes following distance.} In order for you to know the way that you're supposed to go~--- because you've never passed over this way before now~--- don't come near it.''%%
    \verse{3:5} Joshua said to the people, ``Sanctify yourselves because the \textsc{Lord} is going to do something extraordinary in your midst tomorrow.''\footnote{alt., in the future, in time to come. However, we know through context that it is literally the next day.}%%

    \verse{3:14} During the people's journey from their tents to pass over the Jordan, the priests bore the ark of the covenant before the people.%%
    \verse{3:15} And when those bearing the ark came to the Jordan, the feet of the priests bearing the ark dipped into the extremity of the waters (the Jordan being full over all its banks all the days of harvest)%%
    \verse{3:16} and the flowing waters stood and rose up in a heap, far above the city Adam (which is beside Zaretan); and those going down by the sea of the plain~--- the Salt Sea~--- were completely cut off. And the people passed through to Jericho.%%
    \verse{3:17} And the priests bearing the ark of the covenant of the \textsc{Lord} stood established on the dry ground in the midst of the Jordan. And all Israel passed over on dry ground, even until the whole nation had completely passed over the Jordan.%%
