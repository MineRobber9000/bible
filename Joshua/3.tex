    \verse{Joshua^3:14} During the people's journey from their tents to pass over the Jordan, the priests bore the ark of the covenant before the people.%
    \verse{Joshua^3:15} And when those bearing the ark came to the Jordan, the feet of the priests bearing the ark dipped into the extremity of the waters (the Jordan being full over all its banks all the days of harvest)%
    \verse{Joshua^3:16} and the flowing waters stood and rose up in a heap, far above the city Adam (which is beside Zaretan); and those going down by the sea of the plain~--- the Salt Sea~--- were completely cut off. And the people passed through to Jericho.%
    \verse{Joshua^3:17} And the priests bearing the ark of the covenant of the \textsc{Lord} stood established on the dry ground in the midst of the Jordan. And all Israel passed over on dry ground, even until the whole nation had completely passed over the Jordan.%
