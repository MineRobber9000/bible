- Exodus 23:5
- Exodus 24:11
- Numbers 6:3
- Numbers 11:13,18 - Can I omit "because"? It sounds out of place idiomatically.
- Deuteronomy 5:24 - Which part of the sentence is "today/this day" attached to? I think it makes more sense attached to the first part. Why, grammatically, would it be the second part without a conjugation?
- Deuteronomy 5:29 - How are the various translations getting "Oh, that there were such a heart in them" from this? Specifically referring to "Oh!"
- Joshua 3:13 - "the waters that come down from above." Is this referring to precipitation, springs, general upstream water?
- Judges 7:1 - This is a complete mess. "The camp of Midian was on the [south (YLT)|north (DARBY, LSG)] [on the height (YLT)|by the hill (DARBY, LSG)] of Moreh in the valley." What is it? Mitzpon means hidden, secreted away, treasure, sheltered; it certainly doesn't seem to mean north or south.
- Judges 7:8 - What does tsaedah mean?
- Judges 7:17 - what does memeni mean?
- Judges 7:24 - "Come here to meet Midian." Loosely can qara mean a meeting or convocation, but this seems off.
- Ruth 2:1 - l'eesh eesh. "a relation of her husband's." How? I get a man of her husband (possibly a friend)
- Ruth 2:3 - "and her chance happeneth" is in no way similar to "and it really happened."
- Ruth 2:22
- 2 Samuel 6:10 - Can we justify translating soor as "bring"?
- 2 Samuel 6:12 - How does ba'avoor fit into all this?
- 2 Samuel 6:14 - How does m'char'care fit into all this?
- 2 Samuel 6:20 - Can we render c'bad as "magnificent" or "respectable" instead of just "honorable"?
- 2 Samuel 6:22 - "I will make myself more vile than thus" compared to "I will humble myself." qalal seems to mean humbling oneself, not becoming more vile.
- 1 Kings 17:7 - See footnote.
- 1 Kings 18:7 - Can we please have a serious talk about translating he'nay idiomatically?
- 1 Kings 18:9 - Is "your servant" the person speaking?
- 1 Kings 18:10 - What is this talking about? "Is there not a nation or kingdom that my master has sent YOU to seek YOU?"
- 2 Kings 2:2 - What does the idiom "Your soul lives" mean? Also appears in v. 4.
- 2 Kings 2:16 - What does "You shall not send" mean? Can we render this, "You don't get to send."? (As in, you don't have the authority to do this action)
- 2 Kings 5:8 - Can we justify rendering it "horses" and "chariots"?
- 2 Kings 6:5 - How are we supposed to render "he asked"? It seems like it's describing what he's saying and not that he's literally saying, "Ah, my master, he asked!" Or even worse (DARBY), "it was borrowed!"
- 2 Kings 6:21 - How are we to render "shall I smite, shall I smite?"
- 2 Kings 6:25 - Was it worth eighty pieces of silver? Or was it fattened to silver? Is it a verb or a number? Because the number means fifty, not eighty.

- Is there a reason ילך doesn't appear in the KB?
- Can we render amar as "reply" and not just "speak" or "say"?
