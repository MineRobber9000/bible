- Exodus 23:5
- Exodus 24:11
- Numbers 6:3
- Numbers 11:13,18 - Can I omit "because"? It sounds out of place idiomatically.
- Deuteronomy 5:24 - Which part of the sentence is "today/this day" attached to? I think it makes more sense attached to the first part. Why, grammatically, would it be the second part without a conjugation?
- Deuteronomy 5:29 - How are the various translations getting "Oh, that there were such a heart in them" from this? Specifically referring to "Oh!"
- Joshua 3:13 - "the waters that come down from above." Is this referring to precipitation, springs, general upstream water?
- Judges 7:1 - This is a complete mess. "The camp of Midian was on the [south (YLT)|north (DARBY, LSG)] [on the height (YLT)|by the hill (DARBY, LSG)] of Moreh in the valley." What is it? Mitzpon means hidden, secreted away, treasure, sheltered; it certainly doesn't seem to mean north or south.
- Judges 7:8 - What does tsaedah mean?
- Judges 7:17 - what does memeni mean?
- Judges 7:24 - "Come here to meet Midian." Loosely can qara mean a meeting or convocation, but this seems off.
- Ruth 2:1 - l'eesh eesh. "a relation of her husband's." How? I get a man of her husband (possibly a friend)
- Ruth 2:3 - "and her chance happeneth" is in no way similar to "and it really happened."
- Ruth 2:22
- 2 Samuel 6:10 - Can we justify translating soor as "bring"?
- 2 Samuel 6:12 - How does ba'avoor fit into all this?
- 2 Samuel 6:14 - How does m'char'care fit into all this?
- 2 Samuel 6:20 - Can we render c'bad as "magnificent" or "respectable" instead of just "honorable"?
- 2 Samuel 6:22 - "I will make myself more vile than thus" compared to "I will humble myself." qalal seems to mean humbling oneself, not becoming more vile.
- 1 Kings 17:7 - See footnote.
- 1 Kings 18:7 - Can we please have a serious talk about translating he'nay idiomatically?
