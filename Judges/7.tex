    \verse{7:1} Jerubbaal (formerly\footnote{lit., who is} Gideon) and all the people who were with him rose early. They set up\footnote{alt., pitched} a military camp by Harod's well. And they lied in wait\footnote{alt., to conceal oneself} in the valley by the hill Moreh.%%
    \verse{7:2} And the \textsc{Lord} said unto Gideon, ``The people with thee are too great\footnote{many} for me to just give the Midianites into their hand, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, `My own hand hath saved me!'%%
    \verse{7:3} Now, please proclaim within earshot of the people, saying, `Whosoever is fearful and trembling, let him turn back and leave\footnote{go} early from Mount Gilead.''' And 22,000 of the people turned back, and there remained 10,000.%%
    \verse{7:4} And the \textsc{Lord} saith unto Gideon, ``Still, the people are too many. Bring them down to the water and I shall refine\footnote{test} them for you there. It shall be that he to whom I say to thee, `This man shall go with you,' shall go with you; and any that I say unto you, `This man shall not go,' shall not go.''%%
    \verse{7:5} So he brought the people down to the water. And the \textsc{Lord} said unto Gideon, ``Any who laps water with his tongue (like a dog), you shall set by himself. Likewise with those that kneel down to drink.''%%
    \verse{7:6} The number of those who lapped~--- putting their hands to their mouth~--- was 300 men; but all the rest of the people knelt down to drink water.%%
    \verse{7:7} And the \textsc{Lord} saith unto Gideon, ``I will deliver you with the 300 men who lapped; and I will give the Midianites into your hand. Let all the rest go unto their homes.''%%
    \verse{7:8} They took the people's provisions\footnote{\Hebrew{צֵדָה}, from the root \Hebrew{צוד}, is not attested in the KB. However, Davidson includes a Hithpael rendering which can mean \textit{to furnish oneself with provision} (641) from which we can ascertain the root to have something to do with provisions. YLT renders it as ``provision'' and DARBY renders it as ``victuals'' so this seems to be backed up.} and trumpets into their hands. And he sent every male Israelite away, every man to his tent; but he held onto the three hundred men. The Midianites' camp was in the valley below him.%%
    \verse{7:9} That night, the \textsc{Lord} said to him, ``Get up. Go down into the camp because I have delivered the camp into your hand.%%
    \verse{7:10} But if you're afraid to go down, then go down~--- you and your servant Phurah~--- to the camp%%
