    \verse{6:8} The king of Aram hath been fighting against Israel and took counsel with his servants, saying, ``My encamping is wherever.''\footnote{Seriously ``wherever.'' They use \Hebrew{פְּלֹנִי אַלְמֹנִי} which means ``whoever'' or ``whatever.'' It's the same usage as found in Ruth 4:1 to obfuscate who or what is being referred to.}%%
    \verse{6:9} The man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, ``Beware of passing through this place for the Aram\ae{}ans are coming down thence.''%%
    \verse{6:10} So the king of Israel sent to the place of which the man of God had told and warned him. And he\footnote{the king of Israel} stayed on guard. This happened not once, but twice.%%
    \verse{6:11} And the heart of the King of Aram was troubled because of this thing\footnote{i.e., these words}, so he called his servants and saith unto them, ``Will you not tell me which of us is for the king of Israel?''\footnote{i.e., Is there a double agent among us?}%%
    \verse{6:12} One of the servants said, ``None, my lord the king. However, Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the things you have spoken in private.''\footnote{in thy bedchamber.}%%
    \verse{6:13} Then he said, ``Go and see where he is. Then I will send for and fetch him.'' It was then told him, saying, ``He is in Dothan.''%%
    \verse{6:14} So he sent forth horses, chariots, and a great host, and they came by night and surrounded the city.%%
    \verse{6:15} And the man of God's servant arose early and went out, and lo! an army, horses and chariots, surrounded the city. Then his servant said unto him, ``My lord, what shall we do?''\footnote{lit., how do we do? Or, how will we do?}%%
    \verse{6:16} And he said, ``Don't be afraid~--- there are more with us than with them.''\footnote{greater are they who are with us than they who are with them.}%%
    \verse{6:17} And Elisha prayed and said, ``\textsc{Lord}, I pray that thou wilt open his eyes and let him see.'' So the \textsc{Lord} opened the servant's eyes and he saw, and lo! the mountain was full of fiery horses and chariots surrounding Elisha.%%
