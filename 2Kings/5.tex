    \verse{5:1} And Naaman the head of the king of Aram's\footnote{Syria} army was a great and honorable man before the his superior officer\footnote{lord, master} because through him the \textsc{Lord} delivered Aram. Yea, he was a mighty man of valor, but he was a leper.%%
    \verse{5:2} And the Aram\ae{}ans had gone forth in bands and captured a little maid from out of the land of Israel; and she waited upon Naaman's wife.%%
    \verse{5:3} And she said unto her maidservant, ``I wish that my lord was in the presence of the prophet in Samaria! Then he might be healed of his leprosy.''%%
    \verse{5:4} So he went and told his lord, saying, ``Thus and thus said the maid that is from the land of Israel.''%%
    \verse{5:5} The king of Aram said, ``Go! I will send a letter to the king of Israel.'' So he went and took ten talents of silver,\footnote{KB states that a talent is ``normally about 35~kilograms\thinspace=\thinspace75~pounds.'' Ten talents of silver would be equal to roughly 750~pounds (340~kg) of silver, or \$215,687.50 as of 2014-04-26.} six thousand gold pieces, and ten changes of clothes with him\footnote{lit., in his hand. However, this is impossible with this amount of silver.}%%
    \verse{5:6} He brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, ``Now, as this letter comes to you, see that I have sent my servant, Naaman, to you that he may cure your skin disease.''%%
    \verse{5:7} When the king of Israel had read the letter, he rent his garments and said, ``Am I God? Can I\footnote{Understood} kill and give life? Because this man\footnote{Understood} has sent me to heal a man of his skin condition. Please be concerned about this and see because he's presenting himself to me.''%%
