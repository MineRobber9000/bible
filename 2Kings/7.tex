    \verse{7:1} Elisha said, ``Hear the word of the \textsc{Lord}! Thus saith the \textsc{Lord}: `About this\understood\ time tomorrow, a seah\footnote{KB: measure of capacity, in one estimate~= approximately 7~L (7.5~qt)} of fine-ground wheat flour\footnote{KB: ground from inner kernels of wheat} shall be a shekel and two seah of barley shall be a shekel in the gate of Samaria.'\thinspace''%%
    \verse{7:2} The captain on whose hand the king had depended,\footnote{alt., leaned} answered the man of God and said, ``Look, if the \textsc{Lord} made windows\footnote{KB: in the wall through which smoke escape, \textbf{chimney}; windows through which rain falls} in Heaven, would this thing happen?'' He said, ``You shall see it\understood\ with your eyes, but you shall not eat from it.''%%
    
    \verse{7:3} There were four men with a skin condition at the gateway\footnote{lit., the entrance/opening of the gate} and they said one to another, ``What? Are we going to sit here until we die?''%%
    \verse{7:4} If we say, ``Let's go into the city,'' then the famine is in the city and we die there. If we stay here, we die. So now, come and let's invade\footnote{alt., attack; lit., fall on} the Aram\ae{}an camp~--- if we live, we live; if we die, we die.%%
    \verse{7:5} So they got up before sunrise\footnote{lit., twilight; either before sunrise or after sunset, but KB states that in this instance it's before sunrise.} to go to the Aram\ae{}an camp. When\understood\ they came to the outposts of the Aram\ae{}an camp, there wasn't a man there.%%
    \verse{7:6} The Lord made the Aram\ae{}an army hear the sound of chariots and horses and a great army, and they said one to another, ``The king of Israel has hired the king of the Hittites and the king of the Egyptians against us, to come against us!''%%
    \verse{7:7} So they got up and fled\footnote{alt., escaped, slipped away} before sunrise and left their tents, horses, donkeys~--- they left\understood\ the camp as it was and ran\footnote{lit., fled} for their lives.%%
    \verse{7:8} The men with the skin condition came to the edge of the camp, went into a\footnote{lit., one} tent, ate, drank, and took silver, gold, and garments from there, and they went and hid it. Then they came back, entered another tent, took stuff\understood\ from it, and went and hid it.%%
    \verse{7:9} They said one to another, ``We aren't doing right. Today is a day of good news\footnote{KB: either good or bad news, sometimes neutral.} and yet\understood\ we stay silent. If we wait for the morning light, the iniquity will find us. So now, let us go and come in and declare it\understood\ to the king's household.''%%
