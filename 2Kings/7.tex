Thus saith the \textsc{Lord}: `About this\understood\ time tomorrow, a seah\footnote{KB: measure of capacity, in one estimate~= approximately 7~L (7.5~qt)} of fine-ground wheat flour\footnote{KB: ground from inner kernels of wheat} shall be a shekel and two seah of barley shall be a shekel in the gate of Samaria.'\thinspace''%%

He said, ``You shall see it\understood\ with your eyes, but you shall not eat from it.''%%
    
    \verse{7:3} There were four men with a skin condition at the gateway\footnote{lit., the entrance/opening of the gate} and they said one to another, ``What? Are we going to sit here until we die?''%%
    \verse{7:4} If we say, ``Let's go into the city,'' then the famine is in the city and we die there. If we stay here, we die. So now, come and let's invade\footnote{alt., attack; lit., fall on} the Aram\ae{}an camp~--- if we live, we live; if we die, we die.%%
    \verse{7:5} So they got up before sunrise\footnote{lit., twilight; either before sunrise or after sunset} to go to the Aram\ae{}an camp. When\understood\ they came to the outposts of the Aram\ae{}an camp, there wasn't a man there.%%
