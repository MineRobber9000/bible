    \verse{2:1} When the \textsc{Lord} took Elijah into Heaven in the gale,\footnote{alt., heavy windstorm} Elijah and Elisha departed from Gilgal.%%
    \verse{2:2} Elijah said to Elisha, ``Please stay here. \footnote{lit., because}The \textsc{Lord} has sent me to Bethel.'' Elisha responded, ``As the \textsc{Lord} lives and as you\footnote{lit., your personality, individuality, life, desire, mood, state of mind, will, man, person} live, I will not leave\footnote{alt., abandon} you.'' So they went down to Bethel.%%
    \verse{2:3} The sons of the prophets who were in Bethel came out to Elisha, and said, ``Are you aware\footnote{lit., Do you know} that the \textsc{Lord} is taking your master from being in charge\footnote{lit., from your head} today?'' and he said, ``I know. Be quiet!''\footnote{alt., silent}%%
    \verse{2:4} Elijah said to him, ``Elisha, please stay here because the \textsc{Lord} has sent me to Jericho.'' And he responded, ``As the \textsc{Lord} lives and as you live, I will not leave you.'' So they came to Jericho.%%
    \verse{2:5} The prophets' children (in Jericho) approached Elisha, and said to him, ``Are you aware that the \textsc{Lord} is taking your master from being in charge today?'' and he said, ``I know. Be quiet!''%%
    \verse{2:6} Elijah said to him, ``Please stay here because the \textsc{Lord} has sent me to Jordan.'' And he responded, ``As the \textsc{Lord} lives and as you live, I will not leave you.'' So they both went on.%%
    \verse{2:7} Fifty men, sons of the prophets, went and stood aside, far off; and both of them stood by the Jordan.%%
    \verse{2:8} Elijah took his mantle,\footnote{Traditionally rendered as \textit{mantle} and kept that way here.}\footnote{lit., robe (of state), fur garment} rolled it up, beat\footnote{alt., strike, hit} the water with it, and it divided on this side and the other.\footnote{alt., here and there} And they crossed over on dry ground.%%
    \verse{2:9} When they'd crossed over, Elijah said to Elisha, ``Ask what you'd have me do for you before I'm taken from you.'' And Elijah said, ``Please let there be a double portion of your spirit upon me.''%%
    \verse{2:10} He said, ``You've asked for difficult\footnote{alt., hard} thing. If you see me taken from you, then it shall be so to you; otherwise,\footnote{lit., and if not} it shall not be so.''%%
    \verse{2:11} As they were going about talking, a fiery chariot and fiery horses came\footnote{lit., separated} between them both, and Elijah went up in a gale to Heaven.%%
    \verse{2:12} Elisha saw it and cried out, ``My father, my father! The chariot of Israel and its horsemen!''\footnote{alt., riders} And he didn't see him again. He took hold\footnote{lit., strength} of his clothing and ripped it in two.\footnote{lit., two pieces}%%
    \verse{2:13} He picked up Elijah's mantle that had fallen off him and went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan.%%

    \verse{2:23} And he went from there up to Bethel, and as he was going up on the highway, little boys came out of the city and mocked him, saying unto him, ``Go up, bald head! Go up, bald head!''%%
    \verse{2:24} And he turned back, faced them, and cursed them in the name of the \textsc{Lord}. And two mama bears came forth and out of the woods and tore 42 children among them.%%
    \verse{2:25} He then went from there up to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.%%
