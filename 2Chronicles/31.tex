    \verse{31:5} As the matter spread forth, the children of Israel multiplied the first-fruits of corn, new wine, oil, honey, and all the increase of the field: they brought in the tithe of the whole in abundance.%%
    \verse{31:6} The children of Israel and Judah (those dwelling in the cities of Judah) also brought forth a tithe of their herds and flocks,\footnote{``[T]heir'' is taken from context (unless they're presenting a tithe of things they do not own in which case they're following the poor example of Saul (cf. 1 Sam. 15:15)) and the plurality is given for idiomatic purposes.} as well as a tithe of the holy things that are consecrated unto the \textsc{Lord} their God: heaps and heaps brought in.%%
    \verse{31:7} In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps and finished in the seventh month.%%
    \verse{31:8} Hezekiah and the heads of the people\footnote{lit., heads. ``[O]f the people'' is understood, unless we're to assume that Hezekiah came in with a bunch of heads.} came in to see the heaps and to bless the \textsc{Lord} and His people Israel.%%
    \verse{31:9} Hezekiah asked\footnote{inquired at} the priests and the Levites about the heaps%%
    \verse{31:10} and Azariah, the chief priest (of the house of Zadok), spoke unto him and said, ``Since we began taking in the heave offerings to the House of the \textsc{Lord}, there's plenty to eat, be satisfied, and leave abundantly for the \textsc{Lord} hath blessed his people, and this is the surplus.''%%
