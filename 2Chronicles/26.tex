    \verse{26:16} However, when he become strong, his heart was lifted up unto destruction. And he transgressed against the \textsc{Lord} his God by going unto the temple of the \textsc{Lord} and offering incense upon the altar of incense.%%
    \verse{26:17} And Azariah the priest went in after him with the priests of the \textsc{Lord}: eighty valiant men.%%
    \verse{26:18} And they withstood Uzziah the king and said unto him, ``This is not for thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the \textsc{Lord}; rather for the priests~--- the sons of Aaron~--- that are set apart\footnote{consecrated, sanctified} to burn incense. Leave this holy place\footnote{Go out from this sanctuary} for you have transgressed. And neither shall this be for thine honor from the \textsc{Lord} God.''%%
    \verse{26:19} Uzziah was wroth (and in his hand he had a censer of incense). And while he was angry at the priests, leprosy appeared\footnote{rose up} in his forehead in the presence of the priests in the House of the \textsc{Lord} next to the altar of incense.%%
    \verse{26:20} Azariah, the chief priest, and all the priests looked upon him, and lo! he was leprous in his forehead. So they thrust him out from thence, yea, even he\footnote{Uzziah} hurried out because the \textsc{Lord} has smitten him.%%
    \verse{26:21} Uzziah the king was leper unto his dying day~--- he dwelt in a separate house (being a leper) because he was cut off from the House of the \textsc{Lord}. And Jotham, his son, took over\footnote{was over} the king's affairs,\footnote{house} judging the people of the land.%%
