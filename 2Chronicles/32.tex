    \verse{32:1} After these\lit{the} things and this truth, Sennacherib king of Assyria entered and came into Judah; he encamped against the inaccessible cities and said to breach them for himself.%%
    \verse{32:2} But Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come and that his face was against Jerusalem.%%
    \verse{32:3} He counseled with his leaders and his young\halot{sometimes, \textit{strong}} men to stop the fountains of waters outside the city, and they helped him.%%
    \verse{32:4} Many people gathered and they dammed up\alt{stopped} all the fountains and the seasonal river that floods throughout the midst of the land, saying, ``Why do the Assyrian kings come and find a lot of water?''%%
    \verse{32:5} He strengthened himself, rebuilt\lit{built up}\thinspace\understood\ the entire wall that was breached, raised up defensive walls,\alt{towers} built\understood\ another wall outside, strengthened Millo (in the City of David), and made javelins\alt{darts} and shields in abundance.\ed{It's ambiguous whether ``in abundance'' refers to just the javelins or to both the javelins and shields.}%%
    \verse{32:6} He put the battle chiefs over the people and assembled them to himself to a plaza\halot{(open) \textbf{square}, \textbf{plaza} (of a town, village)} gate of the city, and spoke to their heart, saying,%%
    \verse{32:7} ``Be strong and brave. Don't be afraid. Don't be discouraged\alt{filled with terror, terrified, struck down} before\lit{the face of} the king of Assyria or \lit{before}the multitude that is with him because there are more with us than with him.%%
    \verse{32:8} With him is an arm of flesh, but with us is the \textsc{Lord} our God: to help us, to fight our battles.''\ed{\S~--- this is so powerful} And the people were supported by the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.%%
    
    \verse{32:9} After this, Sennacherib king of Assyria sent his servant\ed{Other translations render this in plural (i.e., ``servants'') but it seems to be singular to me.} to Jerusalem~--- but he was by Lachish\ed{around 45~mi (72~km) from Jerusalem} and all of his military forces with him~--- against Hezekiah king of Judah, against all Judah who were in Jerusalem, saying,%%
    \verse{32:10} ``Thus says Sennacherib king of Assyria: `Why\halot{\textit{`al-m\^a} on what basis, \textbf{why}?}\ed{This carries an interesting theological component: Sennacherib is calling them out on their faith. The other rendering, ``On what basis\dots'' is less blasphemous and more inquisitive; however, the former seems to be more true to Sennacherib's character.} do you trust\alt{trust, feel safe, full of confidence} and \ed{understood: still}live in the siege of Jerusalem?%%
    \verse{32:11} Isn't Hezekiah persuading you, to give you to die by famine and thirst, saying, ``The \textsc{Lord} our God will deliver us from the hand\lit{palm} of the king of Assyria''?%%
    \verse{32:12} Hasn't Hezekiah removed his high places\halot{associated with pagan worship and cultic prostitution} and altars, and said to Judah and Jerusalem, saying, ``Bow before one\ed{\textsc{darby} emphasizes ``one.''} altar and make sacrifices\understood\ go up in smoke''?%%
