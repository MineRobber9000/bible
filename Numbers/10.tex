    \verse{Numbers^10:12} The children of Israel set forth on their journey from the wilderness of Sinai and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran.%
    \verse{Numbers^10:13} And the first went not before the face of the \textsc{Lord} by the hand of Moses.%
    \verse{Numbers^10:14} The banner of the camp of Judah set forth first off, according to their ranks; and over its host was Nahshon the son of Amminadab.%
    \verse{Numbers^10:15} Over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar: Nethaneel the son of Zuar.%
    \verse{Numbers^10:16} Over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun: Eliab the son of Helon.%
    \verse{Numbers^10:17} The utensils of the tabernacle were taken down, and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari~--- who carried the tabernacle and its accouterments~--- set forth.%
    \verse{Numbers^10:18} The banner of the camp of Reuben traveled according to their ranks; and over its host was Elizur the son of Shedeur.%
    \verse{Numbers^10:19} Over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon: Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.%
    \verse{Numbers^10:20} Over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad: Eliasaph the son of Deuel.%
    \verse{Numbers^10:21} The carriers of the Holy Place\footnote{Inferred: the Holy of Holies as well.}~--- the Kohathites~--- went forth; and they would be the ones to set up the tabernacle at their\footnote{i.e., the Israelites} coming to a particular spot.%
    \verse{Numbers^10:22} The banner of the camp of the children of Ephraim traveled according to their ranks; and over its host was Elishama the son of Ammihud.%
    \verse{Numbers^10:23} Over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh: Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.%
    \verse{Numbers^10:24} Over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin: Abidan the son of Gideoni.%
    \verse{Numbers^10:25} The banner of the camp of the children of Dan set forth, which was the rear of all the camps throughout their armies: and over its rank was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.%
    \verse{Numbers^10:26} Over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher: Pagiel the son of Ocran.%
    \verse{Numbers^10:27} Over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali: Ahira the son of Enan.%
    \verse{Numbers^10:28} Such were the journeys of the children of Israel according to their ranks when they set forth.%
    \verse{Numbers^10:29} And Moses said to Hobab.\footnote{Jethro} the son of Reuel the Midianite, the father-in-law of Moses, ``We are setting off to the same place that the \textsc{Lord} said, `I will give to you.' Come with us and we will treat you kindly because the \textsc{Lord} hath dealt kindly with Israel.''%
    \verse{Numbers^10:30} But he said, ``I will not go; rather, I will go unto mine own land and to mine own home country.''%
    \verse{Numbers^10:31} And he\footnote{Moses} said, ``Please don't leave me because you know how we should encamp in the desert~--- you shall be our eyes.%
    \verse{Numbers^10:32} ``If you will go with us, it will be good to you in the same measure as the \textsc{Lord} will be\footnote{was. Some slight eisegesis here, but I feel the rendering is more accurate with an eternal perspective. However, it works perfectly well with ``was'' because the Israelites have already been delivered from Egypt.} with us.''%
    \verse{Numbers^10:33} So they set out from the mountain of the \textsc{Lord} a journey of three days, and the Ark of the Covenant of the \textsc{Lord} went before them three days to seek out a place of rest for them.%
    \verse{Numbers^10:34} And the \textsc{Lord}, as a cloud, went over them by day when they journeyed from the camp.%
    \verse{Numbers^10:35} And when the Ark went forth, Moses said, ``Rise up, O \textsc{Lord}, and let thine enemies be scattered; yea, let thine haters flee from before thy face.''%
    \verse{Numbers^10:36} And when it rested he said, ``Return, O \textsc{Lord}, to the tens of thousands of Israelites.''\footnote{10,000 is the largest root describing numbers in Biblical Hebrew.}%
