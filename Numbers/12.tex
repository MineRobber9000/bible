    \verse{Numbers^12:1} Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Kushite\footnote{Possibly Midianite} woman whom he married; for he had taken a Kushite woman in marriage.%

    \verse{Numbers^12:5} Then the \textsc{Lord} went down in the pillar of a cloud and stood in the door of the tent. He called for Aaron and Miriam and they both came out.%
    \verse{Numbers^12:6} He said, ``Heed my words: if you have a prophet the \textsc{Lord} will reveal Himself unto him in a vision. I will speak unto him in a dream.% TODO POETRY FORMATTING
