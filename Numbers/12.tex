\heading{12}{Miriam and Aaron complain against Moses~--- Miriam is cursed with leprosy~--- Moses prays and Miriam is healed}

\begin{enumerate*}[mode=unboxed]
    \verse{12:1} Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Kushite\footnote{Possibly Midianite} woman whom he married; for he had taken a Kushite woman in marriage.%%
    \verse{12:2} They said, ``Has the \textsc{Lord} only spoken through Moses? Hasn't He also spoken through us?'' And the \textsc{Lord} heard it.%%
    \verse{12:3} Now, the man (Moses) was incredibly unassuming\footnote{meek, humble}~--- more than any other man on the face of the earth.\footnote{In other words, he is too humble to fight his own battles. Instead, he lets the Lord fight for him.}%%
    \verse{12:4} The \textsc{Lord} spoke suddenly unto Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, ``The three of you shall go forth unto the tent of meeting.'' So the three of them went forth.%%
    \verse{12:5} Then the \textsc{Lord} went down in the pillar of a cloud and stood in the door of the tent. He called for Aaron and Miriam and they both came out.%%
    \verse{12:6} He said, ``Heed my words: if you have a prophet the \textsc{Lord} will reveal Himself unto him in a vision. I will speak unto him in a dream.%% xxxx: poetry through verse 8
    \verse{12:7} Is it not true that Moses is My servant? That of all My house he is faithful?%%
    \verse{12:8} I speak to him face to face: visibly. Not in riddles. He has seen the form of the \textsc{Lord}. Why weren't you hesitant to speak against my servant Moses?''%%
    \verse{12:9} The \textsc{Lord} grew angry with them and He left.%%
    \verse{12:10} The cloud turned away from the tent\footnote{The Tabernacle. See Appendix~\ref{app:tabernacle}.} and Miriam was leprous\footnote{What is mentioned here as ``leprosy'' is a curable skin condition. See Appendix~\ref{app:psalm-110}.} as snow. Aaron turned to face Miriam and she was leprous.
    \verse{12:11} Moses said, ``My \textsc{Lord}, please do not lay this sin upon us that we foolishly sinned.%%
    \verse{12:12} %% '' NOTES FROM ORIGINAL TRANSLATION: stillborn. much like the appearance of the skin disease, typically rendered as ``leprosy.'' The idea of a malformed stillborn.
    \verse{12:13} Moses cried unto the \textsc{Lord}, saying, ``Oh God, please heal her!''\footnote{\Hebrew{נָא} is used twice to emphasize Moses' plea.}%%
    \verse{12:14} So the \textsc{Lord} said to Moses, ``If her father had spat in her face, would she not be in disgrace for seven days? Let her be removed from the rest of the people and after that\footnote{Understood} she shall be received.''\footnote{We don't know why nothing happened to Aaron. Perhaps it's because he merely gave in to peer pressure (as he was wont to do).}%%
    \verse{12:15} Miriam was confined outside the camp for seven days, and the people did not travel until she was received back into the camp.%%
    \verse{12:16} Then the people up and left Hazeroth and camped in the desert of Paran.%%
