    \verse{Numbers^16:2} They rose up before Moses with two hundred and fifty men of the sons of Israel, leaders of the congregation, and called men\footnote{XXXX: other men?} from the congregation.%%
    \verse{Numbers^16:3} They were assembled against Moses and against Aaron. They said to them,\footnote{To Moses and Aaron} ``XXXX-> That's enough!\footnote{It is too much for you (to do this).} All of the congregation are holy and the \textsc{Lord} is in their midst. Why do you lift yourselves up above the congregation of the \textsc{Lord}?''%%
    \verse{Numbers^16:4} And Moses and Aaron heard this\footnote{Understood} and fell on their faces.\footnote{A sign of distress.}%%
    \verse{Numbers^16:5} He said to Korah and to all of his assembly, saying, ``XXXX Let the \textsc{Lord} make His known~--- who is holy~--- and bring them near to Him XXXX.%%
