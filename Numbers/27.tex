    \verse{27:1} The daughters of Zelophehad (the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, from the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph) came\alt{drew} near, and these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, Tirzah.%%
    \verse{27:2} They stood before Moses and Eleazar the priest and the military\halot{xxxx} leaders and the entire congregation at the door of the Tabernacle,\lit{opening of the tent of meeting} saying,%%
    \verse{27:3} ``Out father died in the wilderness~--- he was not in the midst of the company of Korah who gathered together against the \textsc{Lord}, but from his own sins. And he had no sons.%%
    \verse{27:4} Why should the name of our father be removed from his family? Because he had no sons? Please, give property to us in the midst of our uncles.''\lit{father's brothers.}%%
    \verse{27:5} Moses brought their matter before the \textsc{Lord},%%
    \verse{27:6} and the \textsc{Lord} spoke to Moses, saying,%%
    \verse{27:7} ``The daughters of Zelophehad have rightly spoken. You shall surely give to them an inheritance among their uncles by giving their father's inheritance to them.%%
    \verse{27:8} %%
    \verse{27:9} If he doesn't have a daughter, his inheritance shall go to his brethren.\alt{[nearest?] male relative.}%%
    \verse{27:10} If he has no brothers, you shall give it to his uncles.%%
    \verse{27:11} If his father has no brothers, you shall give his inheritance to his next of kin and he shall possess it.'' Thus it was a statue of judgment to the children of Israel, as the \textsc{Lord} had commanded Moses.%%
