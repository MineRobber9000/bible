    \verse{27:1} The daughters of Zelophehad (the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, from the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph) came\alt{drew} near, and these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, Tirzah.%%
    \verse{27:2} They stood before Moses and Eleazar the priest and the military\halot{xxxx} leaders and the entire congregation at the door of the Tabernacle,\lit{opening of the tent of meeting} saying,%%
    \verse{27:3} ``Out father died in the wilderness~--- he was not in the midst of the company of Korah who gathered together against the \textsc{Lord}, but from his own sins. And he had no sons.%%

    \verse{27:11} If his father has no brothers, you shall give his inheritance to his next of kin and he shall possess it.'' Thus it was a statue of judgment to the children of Israel, as the \textsc{Lord} had commanded Moses.%%
