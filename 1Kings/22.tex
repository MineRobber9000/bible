    \verse{22:1} They\ca{\septuagint\ sg}{singular in the Septuagint} stayed(?) three years without war between Aram\ie{Syria} and Israel.%%
    
    \verse{22:2} In the third year, Jehoshaphat king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.%%
    \verse{22:3} The king of Israel said to his servants, ``Don't you know that Ramoth-Gilead is ours? We are hesitating\alt{postponing, delaying, being silent} from taking it out of the hand of the king of Aram.''%%
    \verse{22:4} He said to Jehoshaphat, ``Will you go down with me\ca{\septuagint\superit{-L}\ \Greek{μεθ᾽ ἡμῶν}}{the Septuagint (except the textus Graecus ex recensione Luciani) says ``after us'' [instead of ``with me'']} to battle in\alt{at} Ramoth-Gilead?'' Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel,\ca{\missing\ \septuagint*\peshitta}{missing in the Septuagint (textus Graecus originalis) and Peshitta} ``I am like you, my people like your people, my horses like your horses.''%%
    \verse{22:5} Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, ``Please inquire the word of\ca{\missing\ \septuagint}{[``the word''] missing in the Septuagint} the \textsc{Lord} today.''\alt{now, (understood) as soon as possible.''}%%
    \verse{22:6} The king of Israel assembled the prophets\ed{not necessarily prophets of the Lord} (about 400~men\lit{400~in number}) and said to them, ``Should I go against Ramoth-Gilead to battle, or should I leave it alone?''\alt{forbear, discontinue, stop?} They said to him, ``Go up and the Lord\ca{\fragheb\ mlt Mss \tetragrammaton}{multiple manuscripts in the Cairo geniza have the Tetragrammaton} will give it into the power\lit{hand} of the king.''%%
    \verse{22:7} Jehoshaphat said, ``Is there not still\ca{\missing\ \septuagint*}{missing in the Septuagint (textus Graecus originalis) [makes more sense this way]} a prophet of the \textsc{Lord} here that we might inquire of\alt{seek} him?''\ed{Jehoshaphat here specifies that he specifically wants to ask a prophet of the Lord.}%%
    \verse{22:8} The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, ``There is yet\ca{\missing\ \septuagint*}{missing in the Septuagint (textus Graecus originalis)} one man by whom we may\understood\ inquire of the \textsc{Lord}, Micaiah\ed{Hebrew for ``Who is like the \textsc{Lord}?''} son of Imlah, but I hate\alt{am unwilling to put up with} him because he does not prophesy good concerning me, rather evil.'' And Jehoshaphat said, ``Don't let the king speak thusly.''\alt{``Please don't say that.''}%%
    \verse{22:9} The king of Israel called to one court official,\halot{(eunuch who is a) \textbf{court official}} and said, ``Quickly! Micaiah son of Imlah.''%%
    \verse{22:10} The king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were sitting, each on his throne, clothed in garments, in the threshing-floor,\ca{dub; \septuagint\ \Greek{ἔνοπλοι}}{doubtful [``clothed in garments, in the threshing-floor'']; the Septuagint has ``xxxx''} at the entrance of the gate of Samaria, and all the prophets prophesied before them.%%
    \verse{22:11} Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made iron imitation,\lit{horns of iron}\halot{\textbf{horns} (part of body, not the material)\dots\ iron imitation \haref{1~K}{22}{11}} and said, ``Thus says the \textsc{Lord}: `You will knock down\alt{butt, thrust, gore} the Aram\ae{}ans with these until you have exterminated them.'\thinspace''%%
    \verse{22:12} All the prophets prophesied thus, saying, ``Go up to Ramoth-Gilead and be successful\alt{succeed, enjoy success} because the \textsc{Lord} will give it\understood\ into the control of the king.''%%
    \verse{22:13} The messenger who went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, ``Please, the words of the prophets are good towards the king with one accord.\lit{with one mouth.} Let your word please be like the word of one of them, and you will have spoken favorably.''\alt{well, good.''}%%
    \verse{22:14} Micaiah said, ``As the \textsc{Lord} lives, whatever the \textsc{Lord} says to me, that will I say.''\ed{Micaiah here shows the proper relationship that man is to have with God. We are not to ask the Lord to conform to what we want, but rather to be humble and be willing to do whatever he asks, even if it's against our will or to our own harm.}%%
    \verse{22:15} He came in to the king, and the king said to him, ``Micaiah, should we\ca{\septuagint\targum\super{f} sg}{singular in the Septuagint and Targum (codex Reuchlinianus (qui Olim \targum\super{L} dicebatur) secundum apparatum criticum Sperberi)} go down to Ramoth-Gilead to battle, or should we\ca{pc Mss \septuagint\targum\super{f} sg}{singular in a few manuscripts of the same} leave it alone?'' He said to him, ``Go up and succeed because the \textsc{Lord} will give it into the control of the king.''\ed{We have no real way of knowing, but it's possible that Micaiah said this dripping with sarcasm, thus prompting Ahab's response.}%%
    \verse{22:16} The king said to him, ``How many times do I have to urge\alt{adjure}\halot{\textbf{adjure}, \textbf{urge} (with an oath)} you that you only tell me the truth in the name of the \textsc{Lord}?''%%
    \verse{22:17} He said:\ed{There is a weird indentation here in the \textsc{bhs}; the colon is to symbolize that.} ``I've seen all of Israel scattered on\alt{to} the mountains like sheep without a shepherd.\lit{like sheep that to them there is not a shepherd} And the \textsc{Lord} has said, `These shall have no master. Let each of them return to his house in peace.'\thinspace''%%
    \verse{22:18} The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, ``Didn't I tell you that he doesn't prophesy good about me, but evil?''%%
    \verse{22:19} He\ie{Micaiah} said, ``Therefore, hear the word of the \textsc{Lord}: I have seen the \textsc{Lord}\ca{\septuagint\ + \Greek{θεὸν Ισραηλ}}{the Septuagint adds ``God of Israel''} sitting on His throne, and all the host of Heaven standing by Him, on His right and on His left.%%
    \verse{22:20} And the \textsc{Lord} said, `Who will lure\alt{persuade, entice} Ahab\ca{\septuagint\vulgate\ ut \caref{2~Ch}{18}{19} + \Hebrew{יִשְׂרָאֵל} \Hebrew{מֶלֶךְ}}{the Septuagint and Vulgate (as in \vref{2~Chr}{18}{19}) adds ``king of Israel''} that he go up and die\lit{fall} in Ramoth-Gilead?' And one said this and another said that.\lit{One spoke like thus, and another spoke like thus.}%%
    \verse{22:21} And the spirit went out and stood before the \textsc{Lord}, and said, `I will entice him.' And the \textsc{Lord} said, `How?'\lit{By what?}\ed{Some translations have ``And the \textsc{Lord} said, `How?'\thinspace'' as part of verse~22.}%%
    \verse{22:22} He said, `I will go and be a lying\alt{deceptive} spirit in the mouth of all of the prophets.' So He said, `You shall persuade him\understood\ and you shall also be successful. Go out and do so.'%%
    \verse{22:23} And now, the \textsc{Lord} has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all of your prophets and the \textsc{Lord} has spoken evil concerning you.''%%
    \verse{22:24} So Zedekiah son of Chenaanah slapped\lit{struck, smote} Micaiah on the cheek, and said, ``How did the spirit of the \textsc{Lord} pass over me to speak to you?''\lit{``Where is this, he's passed over, the spirit of the \textsc{Lord}, from me to speak to you?''}%%
    \verse{22:25} Micaiah said, ``You shall see on that day when you flee\lit{enter, come} into an inner room\ie{a room within a room}\alt{from one room to another} to hide yourself.''\ca{\fragheb\ mlt Mss et \caref{2~Ch}{18}{24} \Hebrew{בא}\hspace*{0em}---}{multiple manuscripts of the Cairo geniza have [a different root, the more common verb ``to hide (oneself)'']}%%

    \verse{22:28} Micaiah said, ``If you actually return in peace,\ed{Meaning ``If you don't die like I said you would.''} the \textsc{Lord} hasn't spoken through me.''

    \verse{22:29} The king of Israel and Jehoshaphat went up to Ramoth-Gilead.%%
    \verse{22:30} The king of Israel told\lit{said to} Jehoshaphat to disguise himself and go into battle: ``You, put on your\ca{\septuagint\ suff 1 sg}{first person singular pronominal suffix in the Septuagint [i.e., ``my clothes'' (which would be a better disguise than his own clothes)]} clothes.'' And the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle.%%
    \verse{22:31} The king of Aram commanded his 32~chariot captains,\lit{the captains of the chariots who were to him 32} saying, ``Don't fight with small\ca{pc Mss et 2~Ch ´\Hebrew{הַקּ}}{a few manuscripts and 2~Chr have ``the small''} or great,\ca{pc Mss et 2~Ch ´\Hebrew{הַגּ}}{a few manuscripts and 2~Chr have ``the great''} but with the king of Israel directly.''\lit{only, by himself.''}%%
    \verse{22:32} When the chariot captains saw Jehoshaphat, they said, ``He's definitely the king of Israel!'' So they encircled him\alt{turned aside to him} to fight him, and Jehoshaphat cried out.%%
    \verse{22:33} When the chariot captains saw that he wasn't the king of Israel, they turned back from following after him.%%
