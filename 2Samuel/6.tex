    \verse{6:6} They came unto Nachon's threshing floor and Uzzah put forth his hand\footnote{Understood} to the ark of God and took hold of it because the oxen stumbled.%%
    \verse{6:7} And the \textsc{Lord} was exceedingly wroth with Uzzah,\footnote{And the anger of the \textsc{Lord} burned against Uzzah} so God smote him there for his error that he died there before the ark of God.\footnote{Referring to this passage (v. 6-7), John Taylor said, ``The ark of God does not need steadying, especially by incompetent men without revelation and without knowledge of the kingdom of God and its laws.'' (\textit{The Gospel Kingdom}, 166)}%%
