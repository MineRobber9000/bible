    \verse{6:2} David and all the people that were with him got up and went from Baale-Judah\footnote{Known as Kiriath-jearim in 1~Chronicles~13\thinspace:\thinspace6.} to take up the Ark of God. God,\footnote{Understood} whose name has been invoked upon it~--- that name being ``The \textsc{Lord} of Hosts who sits between the cherubs.''%%
    \verse{6:3} The Ark of God rode on a new wagon.\footnote{KB: not a chariot.} They lifted it up from Abinadab's house in Gibeah. Uzzah and Ahio, Abinadab's sons, led the new wagon.%%

    \verse{6:6} They came unto Nachon's threshing floor and Uzzah put forth his hand\footnote{Understood} to the ark of God and took hold of it because the oxen stumbled.%%
    \verse{6:7} And the \textsc{Lord} was exceedingly wroth with Uzzah,\footnote{And the anger of the \textsc{Lord} burned against Uzzah} so God smote him there for his error that he died there before the ark of God.\footnote{Referring to this passage (v. 6-7), John Taylor said, ``The ark of God does not need steadying, especially by incompetent men without revelation and without knowledge of the kingdom of God and its laws.'' (\textit{The Gospel Kingdom}, 166)}%%
