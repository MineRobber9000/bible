\heading{16}{The Lord tells Samuel to visit Jesse for one of his sons will be king~--- xxxx}

    \verse{16:1} The \textsc{Lord} said to Samuel, ``How long will you mourn for Saul? I have rejected him from being king of Israel. Fill your horn with oil and go: I will send you Jesse the Bethlehemite because I've seen for Myself a king among his sons.''%%
    \verse{16:2} Samuel said, ``Where should I go? If Saul hears, he'll kill me.''%%
    
    \ca{mlt Mss om interv}{multiple Hebrew manuscripts omit the interval [the section spacing]}The \textsc{Lord} said, ``Take\ca{\qumran\ \Hebrew{ק[ח} cf \septuagint\peshitta}{the Dead Sea Scrolls have [a letter missing], compare the Septuagint and Peshitta}\ed{This is an excellent example of a place where we've been able to use other manuscripts to fill in the blanks in the Dead Sea Scrolls.} a young cow\alt{heifer} from the herd in your hand and say, `I have come to sacrifice to the \textsc{Lord}.'%%
    \verse{16:3} Call for Jesse for the sacrifice, and I will let you know what you're do to, and you shall anoint him whom I've told\lit{said to} you.''%%
    \verse{16:4} Samuel did what the \textsc{Lord} told him: he came to Bethlehem and the city elders trembled to meet him, and one\ie{of the elders}\ca{mlt Mss Seb pl cf \septuagint\peshitta\targum\super{-Ms\thinspace ed\thinspace princ}\vulgate}{multiple Hebrew manuscripts and Sebir are in plural [``they said''], compare the Septuagint, Peshitta, Talmud, and Vulgate} said, ``Do you come in peace?''\ca{\qumran\ + \Hebrew{הראה} cf \septuagint}{the Dead Sea Scrolls add ``\dots, Seer?''}%%
    \verse{16:5} He said, ``Peaceably. I've come to sacrifice to the \textsc{Lord}. Put yourself in a state of dedication\halot{1.\ \textbf{behave as} (people who have been) \textbf{consecrated, made holy} \haref{Ex}{19}{22}; --- 2.\ \textbf{prove oneself} (to be) \textbf{holy} (subject Y.) \haref{Ez}{38}{23}; --- 3.\ \textbf{put oneself} (or each other) \textbf{into the state of dedication} or \textbf{cultic purity} \haref{1S}{16}{5}} and come with me to sacrifice.'' He sanctified Jesse and his sons and called them to the sacrifice.\ed{I initially rendered this ``called them to sacrifice,'' but that doesn't work with Samuel having Priesthood authority and them not.}%%
    \verse{16:6} When they came, he saw Eliab and said, ``Surely the \textsc{Lord}'s anointed is before Him.''%%
    \verse{16:7} But the \textsc{Lord} said to Samuel, ``Don't worry\alt{pay attention to, look at, judge}\halot{xxxx} about how he looks\lit{his appearance} or how tall he is\lit{the height of his stature} because I have rejected him. Because I do not see as a man sees:\ed{xxxx: I think the pronouns are off here} men look on the outward appearance, but the \textsc{Lord} pays attention to the heart.''%%
    \verse{16:8} Jesse called Abinadab and had him walk past Samuel. And he\ie{Samuel} said, ``God hasn't chosen this one either.''\lit{``Also on this not chosen the \textsc{Lord}.''}%%
