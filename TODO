DEFINITE:
Balance column text: http://cs.brown.edu/system/software/latex/doc/balance.pdf
Numbers 12:6-- is poetry. Need indentations from BHS.
list of appendices
verses in header
    ensure correct verse being displayed
footnotes to have verse number associated with them
preface:
    abbreviations (e.g., BHS) (use glossaries package?)
center enumi
    This article explains how to do it. Unfortunately, we will need the newest version of TeX-Live (which Linux Mint has, but it also isn't typesetting bible.tex), so put this off. http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/33144/centre-roman-numbers-in-enumerate-environment
change font: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoefler_Text
    add ligatures
poetry:

UNSURE:
add thumb tabs (fancyhdr can do this)
change enumi count but display correct number (for \bref{})
    not sure if we're going to use hyperref

CHANGELOG (in order):
*general format/layout
*macros? environments?
*change name of TOC (decided against this)
*two column TOC
*dots in TOC (no because Hebrew names are better displayed without it)
*clear up Makefile (add `rm -f` statements, etc)
*add Hebrew name to TOC
*add Hebrew book name to even page header
*write preface
*redefine subsubsection* so that the preface looks better
*add appendix
*add chapter summaries
*syriac
*greek
*hieroglyphs
*fix chapter:verse header so that only chapter:verse is displayed (e.g., 1 Kings 10:1 showing as Kings 10:1 instead of 10:1)
*fix syriac font
*fix work machine's tex engine (had \MakeUppercase in the chapter definition even though there was also \textsc{#1} which makes no sense. Home computer did just fine, work freaked out. Good to know.)
*check if marvosym needed. Nope.
