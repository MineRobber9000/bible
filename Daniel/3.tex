    \verse{3:13} Nebuchadnezzar, in a furious rage, commanded that Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego should be brought in, and those men were brought in before the king.%%
    \verse{3:14} And answering,\footnote{Answering what?} Nebuchadnezzar said to them, ``Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego: is it true that you do not serve my gods nor worship the golden image which I have set up?%%
