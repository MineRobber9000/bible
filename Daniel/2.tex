    \verse{2:1} In the second year of Nebuchadnezzar's reign, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed\footnote{KB: sexual, then general. The context here is not clear if this was a sexual or general dream.} multiple\understood\ dreams and his mind\footnote{alt., temper, disposition, spirit} was disturbed and he couldn't sleep.\footnote{lit., his sleep was gone from him.}%%
    \verse{2:2} The king ordered the soothsayer-priests, the conjurers, the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans to be called in\understood\ to tell\footnote{alt., to give an opinion; this is unlikely as the king would most likely have had them killed for merely opining.} the king what his dreams meant.\footnote{lit., tell the king his dreams; alt., expound the king's dreams to the king.} So they came in and stood before the king.%%
    \verse{2:3} The king said to them, ``I have dreamed a dream and my mind is troubled\footnote{alt., disturbed} to understand\footnote{alt., find out information about, perceive, know, come to understand} the dream.''%%
    \verse{2:4} The Chaldeans spoke to the king in Aramaic:\footnote{The BHS here contains a horizontal break, replicated here. However, the Masorah states ``prb (probably) add (added/addition), prp (it has been proposed) \Hebrew{וַיֹּאמְרוּ}.''}\hspace*{4em}``O King! Live forever! Tell your servants the dream and we'll make its\understood\ interpretation known to you.''%%
    \verse{2:5} The King answered and said to the Chaldeans, ``The spoken word is promulgated by me. If you don't let me know\footnote{alt., communicate it to me} the dream and its interpretation, you will be dismembered\footnote{lit., made into limbs} and your houses will be pulled down as punishment.\footnote{KB: either (houses) shall be turned into public privy [restrooms], or pulled down as punishment; lit., garbage-heap, heap of ruins and debris}%%
    \verse{2:6} If you let me know the dream and its interpretation, you'll receive gifts and presents\footnote{alt., gifts} and great\footnote{alt., much, many, very} honor\footnote{alt., majesty} from before me. So\footnote{lit., Therefore. ``So'' is more casual and I'm picturing Nebuchadnezzar, harsh at first, becoming more casual in an attempt to butter up the Chaldeans and get them to do his bidding. However, it's perfectly likely that he remains majestic and non-casual.} let me know the dream and its interpretation.''%%
    \verse{2:7} They answered the second time and said, ``If\understood\ the king tells\footnote{lit., says to} us the dream,\footnote{lit., Let the king tell the dream to his servants} we'll let you know its interpretation.''%%

    \verse{2:35} xxxx such that no trace of them could be found. However, the stone that struck the image because a great mountain and filled the whole earth.%%
    \verse{2:36} This was the dream. We will now tell its interpretation before the king.%%
    \verse{2:37} You, O king, king of kings to whom the God of Heaven has given the kingdom, might, power, and glory.%%
    \verse{2:38} Wherever the sons of men dwell, He has given the beasts of the field and the birds in the air into your hand, and caused you to rule over all of them: you are the head of gold.%%
    \verse{2:39} Another, lower kingdom shall arise after you. And yet another (third) kingdom of bronze shall rule over all the earth.%%
    \verse{2:40} Then there shall be a fourth kingdom~--- strong as iron~--- which shall arise. It shall break to pieces and shatter all things because it's iron. And like iron, which crushes all these, it shall break and crush.%%
    \verse{2:41} The part made of potter's clay with part iron feet and toes which you saw, it shall be a divided kingdom. But some of the firmness of iron shall be in it~--- as you saw~--- iron mixed with miry clay.%%
    \verse{2:42} The partially iron and partially clay toes of the feet mean that the kingdom shall be part strong and part brittle.%%
    \verse{2:43} The iron mixed with miry clay which you saw, they shall mix offspring, but they will not hold together: just as iron does not mix with clay.%%
    \verse{2:44} In those kings' days, the God of Heaven will set up a kingdom and a sovereignty which shall never be destroyed. It shall not be left to another people. It shall break in pieces and bring to an end all of those kingdoms. Yea, it shall live forever.%%
    \verse{2:45} Just as you saw a stone that was cut from the mountain, but not by hands, and it broke the iron, bronze, clay, silver, and gold in pieces, a great God has made known to the king what shall be hereafter: the dream is certain and its interpretation is sure.''%%
    
    \verse{2:46} Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face and paid homage to Daniel and commanded that an offering of incense be offered to him.%%
    \verse{2:47} The king answered and said to Daniel, ``Truly your God is a God of gods, a lord of kings, and a revealer of mysteries, for you have been able to reveal this mystery!''%%
    \verse{2:48} The king then made Daniel great, gave him many great gifts, and made him a ruler over the whole province of Babylon and chief prefect over all the wise men of Babylon.%%
    \verse{2:49} Daniel requested the king that he appoint Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego over the affairs of the province. And Daniel was in the court of the king.%%
