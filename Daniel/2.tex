    \verse{2:35} xxxx such that no trace of them could be found. However, the stone that struck the image because a great mountain and filled the whole earth.%%
    \verse{2:36} This was the dream. We will now tell its interpretation before the king.%%
    \verse{2:37} You, O king, king of kings to whom the God of Heaven has given the kingdom, might, power, and glory.%%
    \verse{2:38} Wherever the sons of men dwell, He has given the beasts of the field and the birds in the air into your hand, and caused you to rule over all of them: you are the head of gold.%%
    \verse{2:39} Another, lower kingdom shall arise after you. And yet another (third) kingdom of bronze shall rule over all the earth.%%
    \verse{2:40} Then there shall be a fourth kingdom~--- strong as iron~--- which shall arise. It shall break to pieces and shatter all things because it's iron. And like iron, which crushes all these, it shall break and crush.%%
    \verse{2:41} The part made of potter's clay with part iron feet and toes which you saw, it shall be a divided kingdom. But some of the firmness of iron shall be in it~--- as you saw~--- iron mixed with miry clay.%%
    \verse{2:42} The partially iron and partially clay toes of the feet mean that the kingdom shall be part strong and part brittle.%%
    \verse{2:43} The iron mixed with miry clay which you saw, they shall mix offspring, but they will not hold together: just as iron does not mix with clay.%%
    \verse{2:44} In those kings' days, the God of Heaven will set up a kingdom and a sovereignty which shall never be destroyed. It shall not be left to another people. It shall break in pieces and bring to an end all of those kingdoms. Yea, it shall live forever.%%
    \verse{2:45} Just as you saw a stone that was cut from the mountain, but not by hands, and it broke the iron, bronze, clay, silver, and gold in pieces, a great God has made known to the king what shall be hereafter: the dream is certain and its interpretation is sure.''%%
    \verse{2:46} Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face and payed homage to Daniel and commanded that an offering of incense be offered to him.%%
    \verse{2:47} The king answered and said to Daniel, ``Truly your God is a God of gods, a lord of kings, and a revealer of mysteries, for you have been able to reveal this mystery!''%%
    \verse{2:48} The king then made Daniel great, gave him many great gifts, and made him a ruler over the whole province of Babylon and chief prefect over all the wise men of Babylon.%%
    \verse{2:49} Daniel requested the king that he appoint Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego over the affairs of the province. And Daniel was in the court of the king.%%
